	concluded that none of the most commonly used rigid models is satisfactory.
	A new model specifically designed to cope with solid-phase properties
	is proposed. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the equation
	of state and selected points of the melting lines and of the coexistence
	lines involving different ice forms. The phase diagram is then calculated
	for the new potential. The predicted melting temperature of hexagonal
	ice (Ih) at 1 bar is 272.2 K. This excellent value does not imply
	a deterioration of the rest of the properties. In fact, the predictions
	for both the densities and the coexistence curves are better than
	for TIP4P, which previously yielded the best estimations of the ice

	The results yielded by TIP4P and derived models are, in general,
	in fair agreement with experiment. But the differences between the
	experimental phase diagram and the computer simulation for the three
	site models (SPC, SPC/E and TIP3P) and for the five site model TIP5P

  abstract = {A new molecular dynamics method for calculating free energies associated
	with transformations of the thermodynamic state or chemical composition
	of a system (also known as alchemical transformations) is presented.
	The new method extends the adiabatic dynamics approach recently introduced
	by Rosso [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 4389 (2002)] and is based on the use
	of an additional degree of freedom, lambda, that is used as a switching
	parameter between the potential energy functions that characterize
	the two states. In the new method, the coupling parameter lambda
	is introduced as a fictitious dynamical variable in the Hamiltonian,
	and a system of switching functions is employed that leads to a barrier
	in the lambda free energy profile between the relevant thermodynamic
	end points. The presence of such a barrier, therefore, enhances sampling
	in the end point (lambda=0 and lambda=1) regions which are most important
	for computing relevant free energy differences. In order to ensure
	efficient barrier crossing, a high temperature T-lambda is assigned
	to lambda and a fictitious mass m(lambda) is introduced as a means
	of creating an adiabatic separation between lambda and the rest of
	the system. Under these conditions, it is shown that the lambda free
	energy profile can be directly computed from the adiabatic probability
	distribution function of lambda without any postprocessing or unbiasing
	of the output data. The new method is illustrated on two model problems
	and in the calculation of the solvation free energy of amino acid
	side-chain analogs in TIP3P water. Comparisons to previous work using
	thermodynamic integration and free energy perturbation show that
	the new lambda adiabatic free energy dynamics method results in very
	precise free energy calculations using significantly shorter trajectories.

	For this reason, classical all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
	of proteins tend to be confined to local energy minima, particularly
	when the bulk solvent is treated explicitly. To overcome this problem,
	we have developed a novel replica exchange protocol that uses modified
	force-field parameters to treat interparticle nonbonded potentials
	within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving
	unperturbed those relative to solvent-solvent interactions. We have
	tested the new protocol on the 18-residue-long tip of the P domain
	of calreticulin in an explicit solvent. With only eight replicas,
	we have been able to considerably enhance the conformational space
	sampled during a 100 ns simulation, compared to as many parallel
	classical molecular dynamics simulations of the same length or to
	a single one lasting 450 ns. A direct comparison between the various
	simulations has been possible thanks to the implementation of the
	weighted histogram analysis method, by which conformations simulated
	with modified force-field parameters can be assigned different weights.
	Interatom, inter-residue distances in the structural ensembles obtained
	with our novel replica exchange approach and by classical MID simulations
	compare equally well with those derived from NMR data. Rare events,
	such as unfolding and refolding, occur with reasonable statistical
	frequency. Visiting of conformations characterized by very small
	Boltzmann weights is also possible. Despite their low probability,
	such regions of the conformational space may play an important role
	in the search for local potential-energy minima and in dynamically

We show that the ability of an empirical force field to correctly predict the dielectric response of liquids to MW radiation should be evaluated on the basis of a joint comparison of the predicted and experimental static dielectric constant, frequency-dependent dielectric spectra, and heating profiles. We argue that this is essential when multicomponent liquids are studied. We find that both the three-site OPC3 and four-site TIP4P-ϵ empirical force fields of water are equally superior for reproducing dielectric properties at a range of MW frequencies. Despite its poor prediction of the static dielectric constant, the well-known SPCE force field can be used to accurately describe dielectric heating of water at low MW frequencies.}

	dynamics simulations to examine the temporal behavior of nanometer-sized
	aqueous ESI droplets containing a polymer chain and excess ammonium
	ions. The polymer is modeled using a coarse-grained framework where
	a bead-string backbone is decorated with side chains that can be
	nonpolar, cationic, or anionic. Polymers that adopt compact conformations
	and that carry a large number of charged side chains remain close
	to the droplet center, where the charges are extensively hydrated.
	The ESI process for these compact/hydrophilic macromolecules must
	involve solvent evaporation to dryness. This behavior is consistent
	with the charged residue model (CRM). A completely different scenario
	is encountered for disordered (extended) chains that carry a large
	number of nonpolar side chains. In this case, the macromolecule tends
	to be rapidly expelled from the droplet surface in a stepwise sequential
	fashion. This process produces metastable structures where one end
	of the extended polymer chain remains connected with the droplet
	via charge solvation. Disruption of these last interactions will
	then produce a free gas phase macromolecular ion. The data of this
	work imply that the ESI process for unfolded/hydrophobic polymers
	proceeds via an ion evaporation (IEM)-like mechanism that is facilitated
	by hydrophobic solute/solvent interactions. Our model predicts that
	the ESI efficiency of the latter scenario is considerably higher

	In this report, drug effects on viral DNA cleavage and packaging,

	however, this possibility appears unlikely because overproduction
	of neither A- or B-capsids occurred upon drug treatment. Interestingly,
	similar studies coupled with either Western immunoblot or ultrastructural
	analysis showed that B-capsids with apparent normal protein composition
	accumulated at reduced levels (maximally about two- to three-fold)
	in drug-treated cells. Limited attempts to isolate drug-resistant

	dynamics from experiment results. The remaining deviations are typically
	of the order of 10\%\%. The model correctly predicts the temperature
	dependence of the properties except for the density of supercooled
	water. This good performance is achieved despite the known failure
	of the polarization model in reproducing trimer nonadditive interaction
	energies, confirmed here by showing that for a random set of trimers
	with all O-O separations smaller than 3.4 {\AA}, selected from
	simulation snapshots, the average error of the model relative to
	accurate ab initio values is 71\%\%. However, the errors gradually
	decrease for larger trimers, more abundant in liquid, and one can
	estimate that the polarization model should reproduce the exact liquid
	interaction energy to within about 6\%. Although this accuracy is
	consistent with the observed performance of the polarization model,
	it does not explain the dramatic improvements over the two-body model.
	These improvements are due to the restructuring of liquid into tetrahedral
	arrangements instigated by the nonadditive polarization forces. The
	deviations of our predictions from experiments are generally also
	consistent with the estimated contributions from leading neglected
	effects other than the exchange nonadditive forces: the monomer flexibility
	and quantum nuclear motion effects.},

The new method builds upon our iEL/SCF Lagrangian scheme that defines a set of auxiliary induced dipoles whose original purpose was to serve as a time-reversible initial guess to the SCF solution of the set of real induced dipoles. In the new iEL/0-SCF approach the auxiliary dipoles now drive the time evolution of the real induced dipoles such that they stay close to the Born-Oppenheimer surface in order to achieve a truly SCF-less method. We show that the iEL/0-SCF exhibits no loss of simulation accuracy when analyzed across bulk water, low to high concentration salt solutions, and small solutes to large proteins in water. In addition, iEL/0-SCF offers significant computational savings over more expensive SCF calculations based on traditional 1 fs time step integration using symplectic integrators and is as fast as reversible reference system propagator algorithms with an outer 2 fs time step. }

In this work, we expand the theoretical framework of our inertial extended Langrangian, self-consistent field iteration-free method (iEL/0-SCF), introduced for point induced dipoles, to the polarization model of a Drude oscillator. When applied to the polarizable simple point charge model (PSPC) for water, our iEL/0-SCF method for Drude polarization is as stable as a well-converged SCF solution and more stable than traditional extended Lagrangian (EL) approaches or EL formulations based on two temperature ensembles where Drude particles are kept “colder” than the real degrees of freedom. We show that the iEL/0-SCF method eliminates the need for mass repartitioning from parent atoms onto Drude particles, obeys system conservation of linear and angular momentum, and permits the extension of the integration time step of a basic molecular dynamics simulation to 6.0 fs for PSPC water. }

The QM was at a high level, coupled cluster single double triple, for all orientations and distances for water dimer plus X3LYP density functional theory (DFT) on 19 larger water clusters. In addition, we included charge and polarization based on the polarizable charge equilibration method and nonbond interactions from DFT-D3 calculations on the H2 and O2 crystal. This model, denoted as RexPoN, provides quite excellent agreement with experimental (expr) data for the solid and liquid phase of water: Tmelt = 273.3 K (expr = 273.15 K) and properties at 298 K: ΔHvap = 10.36 kcal/mol (expr = 10.52), density = 0.9965 gr/cm3 (expr = 0.9965), entropy = 68.4 (J/mol)/K (expr = 69.9), dielectric constant = 76.1 (expr = 78.4), and ln Ds (self-diffusion coef) = −10.08 (expr = −11.24). Such an accurate force field for water will, we believe, be useful for full solvent calculations of electrocatalysis, where we can restrict QM water to just the first one or two layers involving reactions, using RexPoN to provide the polarization for a more distant solvent. Also, RexPoN may provide a better description of the solvent for proteins, DNA, polymers, and inorganic systems for applications to biomolecular, pharma, electrocatalysis (fuel cells and water splitting), and batteries where interaction with explicit water molecules plays a significant role.  }

doi = {10.1073/pnas.1817383116},
publisher = {National Academy of Sciences},
abstract = {In contrast to ice, in which each water makes strong hydrogen bonds (SHBs) to four neighbors, we show that upon melting the number of SHBs drops quickly to two in liquid water. These two SHBs couple into chains containing \~{}150 waters resembling a branched polymer. The lifetime of each SHB at 298 K is 90.3 fs (11 OH vibrational periods), so the polymer branches evolve dynamically. This dynamics-branched polymer paradigm may explain long-standing puzzles of water, such as the critical point at 227 K in supercooled water (which may correspond to a glass transition caused by an increase in the SHB lifetime). It may explain the observed angular correlations in water that persist for 20 nm.We developed the RexPoN force field for water based entirely on quantum mechanics. It predicts the properties of water extremely accurately, with Tmelt = 273.3 K (273.15 K) and properties at 298 K: ΔHvap = 10.36 kcal/mol (10.52), density = 0.9965 g/cm3 (0.9965), entropy = 68.4 J/mol/K (69.9), and dielectric constant = 76.1 (78.4), where experimental values are in parentheses. Upon heating from 0.0 K (ice) to 273.0 K (still ice), the average number of strong hydrogen bonds (SHBs, rOO <= 2.93 {\r A}) decreases from 4.0 to 3.3, but upon melting at 273.5 K, the number of SHBs drops suddenly to 2.3, decreasing slowly to 2.1 at 298 K and 1.6 at 400 K. The lifetime of the SHBs is 90.3 fs at 298 K, increasing monotonically for lower temperature. These SHBs connect to form multibranched polymer chains (151 H2O per chain at 298 K), where branch points have 3 SHBs and termination points have 1 SHB. This dynamic fluctuating branched polymer view of water provides a dramatically modified paradigm for understanding the properties of water. It may explain the 20-nm angular correlation lengths at 298 K and the critical point at 227 K in supercooled water. Indeed, the 15\% jump in the SHB lifetime at 227 K suggests that the supercooled critical point may correspond to a phase transition temperature of the dynamic polymer structure. This paradigm for water could have a significant impact on the properties for protein, DNA, and other materials in aqueous media.},

They are not seen just in atoms and molecules but also in larger nanostructures and even macroscopic objects. Ambrosetti et al. created a qualitatively correct description of van der Waals interactions between polarizable nanostructures over a wide range of finite distances. This required delocalized electrons that have wavelike electron density fluctuations, unlike the more common approaches with dipoles fixed on atoms. Furthermore, the authors observed an enhancement in the nonlocality of the charge density response on the scale of 10 to 20 nm.Science, this issue p. 1171Recent experiments on noncovalent interactions at the nanoscale have challenged the basic assumptions of commonly used particle- or fragment-based models for describing van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion forces. We demonstrate that a qualitatively correct description of the vdW interactions between polarizable nanostructures over a wide range of finite distances can only be attained by accounting for the wavelike nature of charge density fluctuations. By considering a diverse set of materials and biological systems with markedly different dimensionalities, topologies, and polarizabilities, we find a visible enhancement in the nonlocality of the charge density response in the range of 10 to 20 nanometers. These collective wavelike fluctuations are responsible for the emergence of nontrivial modifications of the power laws that govern noncovalent interactions at the nanoscale.},

	inhibition, the energy of binding of four inhibitor molecules (PEO,

	dynamic simulations. One key feature of this proposed mechanism is
	that the binding of an inhibitor molecule to the surface of an ensuing
	hydrate crystal disrupts growth and therein crystallization. It is
	found through the molecular dynamic simulations that inhibitor molecules
	that experimentally exhibit better inhibition strength also have
	higher free energies of binding, an indirect confirmation of our
	proposed mechanism. Inhibitors increasing in effectiveness, PEO <
	PVP < PVCap < VIMA, have increasingly negative (exothermic) binding
	energies of -0.2 < -20.6 < -37.5 < -45.8 kcal/mol and binding free
	energies of increasing favorability (+0.4~ +0.5 < -9.4 < -15.1 kcal/mol).
	Furthermore, the effect of an inhibitor molecule on the local liquid
	water structure under hydrate-forming conditions was examined and
	correlated to the experimental effectiveness of the inhibitors. Two
	molecular characteristics that lead to strongly binding inhibitors
	were found: (1) a charge distribution on the edge of the inhibitor
	that mimics the charge separation in the water molecules on the surface
	of the hydrate and (2) the congruence of the size of the inhibitor
	with respect to the available space at the hydrate-surface binding
	site. Equipped with this molecular-level understanding of the process
	of hydrate inhibition via low-dosage kinetic hydrate inhibitors we

	both in nature and in materials science and highlight a ''new twist''-the
	recent recognition of polymorphism within the glassy state, The formation
	of glass by continuous cooling (viscous slowdown) is then examined,
	the strong/fragile liquids classification is reviewed, and a new
	twist-the possibility that the slowdown is a result of an avoided
	critical point-is noted, The three canonical characteristics of relaxing
	liquids are correlated through the fragility. As a further new twist,
	the conversion of strong liquids to fragile liquids by pressure-induced
	coordination number increases is demonstrated, It is then shown that,
	for comparable systems, it is possible to have the same conversion
	accomplished via a first-order transition within the liquid state
	during quenching, This occurs in the systems in which ''polyamorphism''
	(polymorphism in the glassy state) is observed, and the whole phenomenology
	is accounted for by Poole's bond-modified van der Waals model, The
	sudden loss of some liquid degrees of freedom through such weak first-order
	transitions is then related to the polyamorphic transition between
	native and denatured hydrated proteins, since the latter are also
	glass-forming systems-water-plasticized, hydrogen bond-cross-linked
	chain polymers (and single molecule glass formers), The circle is
	closed with a final new twist by noting that a short time scale phenomenon
	much studied by protein physicists-namely, the onset of a sharp change
	in d [r(2)] /dT ([r(2)] is the Debye-Waller factor)-is general for
	glass-forming liquids, including computer-simulated strong and fragile
	ionic liquids, and is closely correlated with the experimental glass
	transition temperature, The latter thus originates in strong anharmonicity
	in certain components of the vibrational density of states, which
	permits the system to access the multiple minima of its configuration
	space, The connection between the anharmonicity in these modes, vibrational
	localization, the Kauzmann temperature, and the fragility of the

	water indicate that the glass transition in ambient-pressure water
	is qualitatively distinct from that found in the usual molecular
	liquids. It belongs instead to the order-disorder class of transition
	seen in molecular and ionic crystalline materials. The distinctive
	``folding funnel'' energy landscape for this type of system explains
	the extreme weakness of the glass transition of water as well as
	the consequent confusion that has characterized its scientific history;
	it also explains the very small excess entropy at the glass transition
	temperature. The relation of confined water behavior to that of bulk
	is discussed, and the ``fragile-to-strong'' transition for supercooled
	water is interpreted by adding a ``critical point-free'' scenario
	to the two competing scenarios for understanding supercooled bulk
	water.},

  abstract = {A polarizable empirical force field based on the classical Drude oscillator
	has been developed for the aliphatic alcohol series. The model is
	optimized with an emphasis on condensed-phase properties and is validated
	against a variety of experimental data. Transferability of the developed
	parameters is emphasized by the use of a single electrostatic model
	for the hydroxyl group throughout the alcohol series. Aliphatic moiety
	parameters were transferred from the polarizable alkane parameter
	set, with only the Lennard-Jones parameters on the carbon in methanol
	optimized. The developed model yields good agreement with pure solvent
	properties with the exception of the heats of vaporization of 1-propanol
	and 1-butanol, which are underestimated by approximately 6\%; special
	LJ parameters for the oxygen in these two molecules that correct
	for this limitation are presented. Accurate treatment of the free
	energies of aqueous solvation required the use of atom-type specific
	Oalcohol-Owater LJ interaction terms, with specific terms used for
	the primary and secondary alcohols. With respect to gas-phase properties
	the polarizable model overestimates experimental dipole moments and
	quantum mechanical interaction energies with water by approximately
	10 and 8\%, respectively, a significant improvement over 44 and 46\%
	overestimations of the corresponding properties in the CHARMM22 fixed-charge
	additive model. Comparison of structural properties of the polarizable
	and additive models for the pure solvents and in aqueous solution
	shows significant differences indicating atomic details of intermolecular
	interactions to be sensitive to the applied force field. The polarizable
	model predicts pure solvent and aqueous phase dipole moment distributions
	for ethanol centered at 2.4 and 2.7 D, respectively, a significant
	increase over the gas-phase value of 1.8 D, whereas in a solvent
	of lower polarity, benzene, a value of 1.9 is obtained. The ability
	of the polarizable model to yield changes in the dipole moment as
	well as the reproduction of a range of condensed-phase properties
	indicates its utility in the study of the properties of alcohols
	in a variety of condensed-phase environments as well as representing
	an important step in the development of a comprehensive force field
	for biological molecules.},

  abstract = {We report a numerical calculation of the melting point of NaCl. The
	solid--liquid transition was located by determining the point where
	the chemical potentials of the solid and liquid phases intersect.
	To compute these chemical potentials, we made use of free energy
	calculations. For the solid phase the free energy was determined
	by thermodynamic integration from the Einstein crystal. For the liquid
	phase two distinct approaches were employed: one based on particle
	insertion and growth using the Kirkwood coupling parameter, and the
	other involving thermodynamic integration of the NaCl liquid to a
	Lennard-Jones fluid. The latter approach was found to be significantly
	more accurate. The coexistence point at 1074 K was characterized
	by a pressure of --30+/-40 MPa and a chemical potential of --97.9+/-0.2kbetaT.
	This result is remarkably good as the error bounds on the pressure
	enclose the expected coexistence pressure of about 0.1 MPa (ambient).
	Using the Clausius--Clapyron relation, we estimate that dP/dT[approximate]3
	MPa/K. This yields a melting point of 1064+/-14 K at ambient pressure,
	which encompasses the quoted range for the experimental melting point
	(1072.45--1074.4 K). The good agreement with the experimental melting-point
	data provides additional evidence that the Tosi--Fumi model for NaCl
	is quite accurate. Our study illustrates that the melting point of
	an ionic system can be calculated accurately by employing a judicious
	combination of free energy techniques. The techniques used in this
	work can be directly extended to more complex, charged systems.},

  abstract = {The aquaglyceroporin from Plasmodium falciparum (PfAQP) is a potential
	drug target for the treatment of malaria. It efficiently conducts
	water and other small solutes, and is proposed to intervene in several
	crucial physiological processes during the parasitic life cycle.
	Despite the wealth of experimental data available, a dynamical and
	energetic description at the single-molecule level of the solute
	permeation through PfAQP has been lacking so far. Here we address
	this question by using equilibrium and umbrella sampling molecular
	dynamics simulations. We computed the water osmotic permeability
	coefficient, the pore geometry and the potential of mean force for
	the permeation of water, glycerol and urea. Our simulations show
	that the PfAQP, the human aquaporin 1 (hAQP1) and the Escherichia
	coli glycerol facilitator (GlpF) have nearly identical water permeabilities.
	The Arg196 residue at the ar/R region was found to play a crucial
	role regulating the permeation of water, glycerol and urea. The computed
	free energy barriers at the ar/R selectivity filter corroborate that
	PfAQP conducts glycerol at higher rates than urea, and suggest that
	PfAQP is a more efficient glycerol and urea channel than GlpF. Our
	results are consistent with a solute permeation mechanism for PfAQP
	which is similar to the one established for other members of the
	aquaglyceroporin family. In this mechanism, hydrophobic regions near
	the NPA motifs are the main water rate limiting barriers, and the
	replacement of water-arg196 interactions and solute-matching in the
	hydrophobic pocket at the ar/R region are the main determinants underlying
	selectivity for the permeation of solutes like glycerol and urea.},

The melting points obtained by the three routes are consistent with each other. The calculated T m of the Tosi-Fumi model of NaCl is in good agreement with the experimental value as well as with other numerical calculations. However, the other two models considered for NaCl, SD and JC, overestimate the melting temperature of NaCl by more than 200 K. We have also computed the melting temperature of other alkali halides using the Tosi-Fumi interaction potential and observed that the predictions are not always as close to the experimental values as they are for NaCl. It seems that there is still room for improvement in the area of force-fields for alkaline halides, given that so far most models are still unable to describe a simple yet important property such as the melting point."

The i-TTM potentials are derived from fits to electronic structure data and include an explicit treatment of two-body repulsion, electrostatics, and dispersion energy. Many-body effects are represented through classical polarization within an extended Thole-type model. By construction, the i-TTM potentials are compatible with the flexible and fully ab initio MB-pol potential, which has recently been shown to accurately predict the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase. The accuracy of the i-TTM potentials is assessed through extensive comparisons with CCSD(T)-F12, DF-MP2, and DFT data as well as with results obtained with common polarizable force fields for X-(H2O)n clusters with X- = F-, Cl-, Br-, and I-, and n = 1-8. By construction, the new i-TTM potentials will enable direct simulations of vibrational spectra of halide-water systems from clusters to bulk and interfaces. }

	A library of peptidomimetics was derived by grafting onto a hairpin-inducing
	D-Pro-L-Pro template sequences related to the RNA recognition element
	in Tat. One hairpin mimetic was identified that binds tightly (K-d
	approximate to 150 nM) to BIV TAR, and another that binds also to
	HIV-1 TAR RNA (K-d approximate to 1-2 muM). (In the same assay, the
	wild-type BIV Tat(65-81) peptide binds to BIV TAR with K-d approximate
	to 50 nM.) The high-affinity BIV-Tat mimetic was shown to adopt a
	stable beta-hairpin conformation in free solution by NMR methods.
	Amino acid substitutions in this mimetic were shown to impact on
	the hairpin structure and to disrupt binding to the RNA. This family
	of conformationally constrained peptidomimetics affords insights
	into the structural requirements for binding to TAR RNA and provides
	a basis for the design of new ligands with increased inhibitory activity
	and specificity to both BIV and HIV TAR RNAs. 0002-7863}

abstract = { We introduce a new class of methods, denoted as Truncated Conjugate Gradient(TCG), to solve the many-body polarization energy and its associated forces in molecular simulations (i.e. molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo). The method consists in a fixed number of Conjugate Gradient (CG) iterations. TCG approaches provide a scalable solution to the polarization problem at a user-chosen cost and a corresponding optimal accuracy. The optimality of the CG-method guarantees that the number of the required matrix-vector products are reduced to a minimum compared to other iterative methods. This family of methods is non-empirical, fully adaptive, and provides analytical gradients, avoiding therefore any energy drift in MD as compared to popular iterative solvers. Besides speed, one great advantage of this class of approximate methods is that their accuracy is systematically improvable. Indeed, as the CG-method is a Krylov subspace method, the associated error is monotonically reduced at each iteration. On top of that, two improvements can be proposed at virtually no cost: (i) the use of preconditioners can be employed, which leads to the Truncated Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (TPCG); (ii) since the residual of the final step of the CG-method is available, one additional Picard fixed point iteration (“peek”), equivalent to one step of Jacobi Over Relaxation (JOR) with relaxation parameter ω, can be made at almost no cost. This method is denoted by TCG-n(ω). Black-box adaptive methods to find good choices of ω are provided and discussed. Results show that TPCG-3(ω) is converged to high accuracy (a few kcal/mol) for various types of systems including proteins and highly charged systems at the fixed cost of four matrix-vector products: three CG iterations plus the initial CG descent direction. Alternatively, T(P)CG-2(ω) provides robust results at a reduced cost (three matrix-vector products) and offers new perspectives for long polarizable MD as a production algorithm. The T(P)CG-1(ω) level provides less accurate solutions for inhomogeneous systems, but its applicability to well-conditioned problems such as water is remarkable, with only two matrix-vector product evaluations. }

abstract = {In a recent paper [F. Aviat et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 13, 180-190 (2017)], we proposed the Truncated Conjugate Gradient (TCG) approach to compute the polarization energy and forces in polarizable molecular simulations. The method consists in truncating the conjugate gradient algorithm at a fixed predetermined order leading to a fixed computational cost and can thus be considered “non-iterative.” This gives the possibility to derive analytical forces avoiding the usual energy conservation (i.e., drifts) issues occurring with iterative approaches. A key point concerns the evaluation of the analytical gradients, which is more complex than that with a usual solver. In this paper, after reviewing the present state of the art of polarization solvers, we detail a viable strategy for the efficient implementation of the TCG calculation. The complete cost of the approach is then measured as it is tested using a multi-time step scheme and compared to timings using usual iterative approaches. We show that the TCG methods are more efficient than traditional techniques, making it a method of choice for future long molecular dynamics simulations using polarizable force fields where energy conservation matters. We detail the various steps required for the implementation of the complete method by software developers.}

Independently of the cluster size, it is found that all four halides prefer surface-type structures in which they occupy one of the vertices in the underlying three-dimensional hydrogen-bond networks. For fluoride–water clusters, this is in contrast to previous reports suggesting that fluoride prefers interior-type arrangements, where the ion is fully hydrated. These differences can be ascribed to the variability in how various molecular models are capable of reproducing the subtle interplay between halide–water and water–water interactions. Our results thus emphasize the importance of a correct representation of individual many-body contributions to the molecular interactions for a quantitative description of halide ion hydration. }

In this paper we prove that it can be applied using sources of point charges other than those from direct restrained fitting to electrostatic potential (RESP). We used a newly established databank of tabulated invariom point charges and a widely known semiempirical method. Both sources perform equivalently to the basic aug-PROmol method as well as to reference energies at the DFT-SAPT/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory. This is possible due to the universal character of the penetration model included in the aug-PROmol. Aug-PROmol may become a basis for development of new nonbonded terms in force fields or a high success rate scoring function. }

Here, we report the development of full-dimensional many-body potential energy functions, called MB-nrg (Many-Body-energy), for molecular simulations of halide ion-water systems from the gas phase to the condensed phase. The MB-nrg potentials are derived entirely from “first-principles” calculations carried out at the F12 explicitly correlated coupled-cluster level including single, double, and perturbative triple excitations, CCSD(T)-F12, in the complete basis set limit. Building upon the functional form of the MB-pol water potential, the MB-nrg potentials are expressed through the many-body expansion of the total energy in terms of explicit contributions representing one-body, two-body, and three-body interactions, with all higher-order contributions being described by classical induction. The specific focus of this study is on the MB-nrg two-body terms representing the full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) of the corresponding H2O-X- dimers, with X-= F-, Cl-, Br-, and I-. The accuracy of the MB-nrg PESs is systematically assessed through extensive comparisons with results obtained using both ab initio models and polarizable force fields for energies, structures, and harmonic frequencies of the H2O-X- dimers.}

  abstract = {In order to reduce computational effort and to allow for the use of
	periodic boundary conditions, electrostatic interactions in explicit
	solvent simulations of molecular systems do not obey Coulomb's law.
	Instead, a number of ``effective potentials'' have been proposed,
	including truncated Coulomb, shifted, switched, reaction-field corrected,
	or Ewald potentials. The present study compares the performance of
	these schemes in the context of ionic solvation. To this purpose,
	a generalized form of the Born continuum model for ion solvation
	is developed, where ion-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions
	are determined by these effective potentials instead of Coulomb's
	law. An integral equation is formulated for calculating the polarization
	around a spherical ion from which the solvation free energy can be
	extracted. Comparison of the polarizations and free energies calculated
	for specific effective potentials and the exact Born result permits
	an assessment of the accuracy of these different schemes. Additionally,
	the present formalism can be used to develop corrections to the ionic
	solvation free energies calculated by molecular simulations implementing
	such effective potentials. Finally, an arbitrary effective potential
	is optimized to reproduce the Born polarization.},

The central ions' Madelung constants in a succession of progressively larger structures with the same symmetry as the bulk converge rapidly to the bulk Madelung constant if all the precursors to the bulk are electrically neutral. If this condition is satisfied, convergence is faster than other methods and is simpler to implement than the classical Ewald method.

It relies on using the momentum representation for the kinetic energy operator and the coordinate representation for the potential energy. The first computer program (FGHEVEN) is based on an explicit (very simple) expression for the Hamiltonian matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix give the required bound-state energies and the eigenvectors yield directly the eigenfunctions evaluated on the regularly spaced grid points. In this paper the theory has been slightly extended to encompass the situation where an even number of grid points is used. The second program (FGHFFT) is based on a complimentary theory which makes use of the discrete fast Fourier transform technique to evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix. The programs are self-contained and include subroutines to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors needed. "

	the hydrate is always treated as an ideal solid solution. Several
	limitations of this method have been removed in a new derivation

	hydrate lattice fugacity has been given. This allows for description
	of the hydrate phase itself, instead of a specific phase change.
	The ideal solid solution assumption is removed by defining a specific
	volume of the standard hydrate lattice. The activity of water in
	the hydrate is a function of the energy difference between the real
	and standard lattice. This approach, which allows for distortion
	of the hydrate from its standard state, is believed to give a more
	accurate composition of the hydrate. We propose to make the cage

	incorporation of spectroscopic data is crucial for parameter optimization

  abstract = {Lipid monolayers at an air-water interface can be compressed laterally
	and reach high surface density. Beyond a certain threshold, they
	become unstable and collapse. Lipid monolayer collapse plays an important
	role in the regulation of surface tension at the air-liquid interface
	in the lungs. Although the structures of lipid aggregates formed
	upon collapse can be characterized experimentally, the mechanism
	leading to these structures is not fully understood. We investigate
	the molecular mechanism of monolayer collapse using molecular dynamics
	simulations. Upon lateral compression, the collapse begins with buckling
	of the monolayer, followed by folding of the buckle into a bilayer
	in the water phase. Folding leads to an increase in the monolayer
	surface tension, which reaches the equilibrium spreading value. Immediately
	after their formation, the bilayer folds have a flat semielliptical
	shape, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The folds undergo
	further transformation and form either flat circular bilayers or
	vesicles. The transformation pathway depends on macroscopic parameters
	of the system: the bending modulus, the line tension at the monolayer-bilayer
	connection, and the line tension at the bilayer perimeter. These
	parameters are determined by the system composition and temperature.
	Coexistence of the monolayer with lipid aggregates is favorable at
	lower tensions of the monolayer-bilayer connection. Transformation
	into a vesicle reduces the energy of the fold perimeter and is facilitated
	for softer bilayers, e.g., those with a higher content of unsaturated
	lipids, or at higher temperatures.},

  pages = {359--373},
  abstract = {We discuss a new classical water force field that explicitly accounts
	for differences in polarizability between liquid and vapor phases.
	The TIP4P-QDP (4-point transferable intermolecular potential with
	charge-dependent polarizability) force field is a modification of
	the original TIP4P-FQ fluctuating charge water force field of Rick
	et al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 1994, 101, 6141] that self-consistently
	adjusts its atomic hardness parameters via a scaling function dependent
	on the M-site charge. The electronegativity (X) parameters are also
	scaled in order to reproduce condensed-phase dipole moments of comparable
	magnitude to TIP4P-FQ. TIP4P-QDP is parametrized to reproduce experimental
	gas-phase and select condensed-phase properties. The TIP4P-QDP water
	model possesses a gas phase polarizability of 1.40 angstrom(3) and
	gas-phase dipole moment of 1.85 Debye, in excellent agreement with
	experiment and high-level ab initio predictions. The liquid density
	of TIP4P-QDP is 0.9954 (+/- 0.0002) g/cm(3) at 298 K and 1 atm, and
	the enthalpy of vaporization is 10.55 (+/- 0.12) kcal/mol. Other
	condensed-phase properties such as the isobaric heat capacity, isothermal
	compressibility, and diffusion constant are also calculated within
	reasonable accuracy of experiment and consistent with predictions
	of other current state-of-the-art water force fields. The average
	molecular dipole moment of TIP4P-QDP in the condensed phase is 2.641
	(+/- 0.001) Debye, approximately 0.02 Debye higher than TIP4P-FQ
	and within the range of values currently surmised for the bulk liquid.
	The dielectric constant, epsilon = 85.8 +/- 1.0, is 10\% higher than
	experiment. This is reasoned to be due, to the increase in the condensed
	phase dipole moment over TIP4P-FQ, which estimates c remarkably well.
	Radial distribution functions for TIP4P-QDP and TIP4P-FQ show similar
	features, with TIP4P-QDP showing slightly reduced peak heights and
	subtle shifts toward larger distance interactions. Since the greatest
	effects of the phase-dependent polarizability are anticipated in
	regions with both liquid and vapor character, interfacial simulations
	of TIP4P-QDP were performed and compared to TIP4P-FQ, a static polarizability
	analog. Despite similar features in density profiles such as the
	position of the GDS and interfacial width, enhanced dipole moments
	are observed for the TIP4P-QDP interface and onset of the vapor phase.
	Water orientational profiles show an increased preference (over TIP4P-FQ)
	in the orientation of the permanent dipole vector of the molecule
	within the interface; an enhanced z-induced dipole moment directly
	results from this preference. Hydrogen bond formation is lower, on
	average, in the bulk for TIP4P-QDP than TIP4P-FQ. However, the average
	number of hydrogen bonds formed by TIP4P-QDP in the interface exceeds
	that of TIP4P-FQ and observed hydrogen bond networks extend further
	into the gaseous region. The TIP4P-QDP interfacial potential, calculated
	to be -11.98 (+/- 0.08) kcal/mol, is less favorable than that for
	TIP4P-FQ by approximately 2\% as a result of a diminished quadrupole
	contribution. Surface tension is calculated within a 1.3\% reduction
	from the experimental value. Results reported demonstrate TIP4P-QDP
	as a model comparable to the popular TIP4P-FQ while accounting for
	a physical effect neglected by many other classical water models.
	Further refinements to this model, as well as future applications
	are discussed.},

	temperatures. In our second REMD simulation, which starts from a
	normative conformation, there was no evidence of significant folding.
	Transitions from the unfolded to the folded state did not occur on
	the timescale of these simulations, despite the expected improvement
	in sampling of REMD over conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
	The combined 1.42 mu s of simulation time was insufficient for REMD
	simulations with different starting structures to converge. Conventional
	MID simulations at a range of temperatures were also performed. In
	contrast to REMD, the conventional MD simulations provide an estimate
	of Tm in good agreement with experiment. Furthermore, the conventional
	MD is a fraction of the cost of REMD and continuous, realistic pathways
	of the unfolding process at atomic resolution are obtained. (c) 2006

	Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh (PPPM) method for evaluation of Coulomb
	energies and forces in simulations of charged particles. Rather than
	taking the usual approach, solving Poisson's equation by means of
	a Fourier transformation, we use an iterative Poisson solver. In
	a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation the solution from the previous
	time-step provides a good starting point for the next solution. This
	reduces the number of iterations per time-step to acceptable values.
	The iterative scheme has a complexity O(N), and, in contrast with
	the Fourier transform based approach, it is easily implemented on
	a parallel architecture with a minimum of communication overhead.
	We examine the origin of the errors in the algorithm and find that
	reasonable accuracies in the Coulomb interaction can best be attained
	by making the charge density profile as smooth as possible. This
	involves spreading the particle charges over a large number of grid
	points. Assigning these charges then becomes the most time consuming
	part of the algorithm. We show how we can then gain a considerable
	saving in computing time by employing a diffusion equation as a charge
	spreading mechanism. The effect of employing the algorithm with an
	accuracy less than that typically tolerated in an Ewald summation
	is studied by computing, from an MD simulation of silica, quantities
	that are sensitive to the long range part of the Coulomb interaction.
	These results are compared to full Ewald sum reference simulations
	and found to be within the statistical error. 0892-7022}

abstract = {Nowadays, computer simulations have become a standard tool in essentially all fields of chemistry, condensed matter physics, and materials science. In order to keep up with state-of-the-art experiments and the ever growing complexity of the investigated problems, there is a constantly increasing need for simulations of more realistic, i.e., larger, model systems with improved accuracy. In many cases, the availability of sufficiently efficient interatomic potentials providing reliable energies and forces has become a serious bottleneck for performing these simulations. To address this problem, currently a paradigm change is taking place in the development of interatomic potentials. Since the early days of computer simulations simplified potentials have been derived using physical approximations whenever the direct application of electronic structure methods has been too demanding. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) now offer an alternative approach for the representation of potential-energy surfaces by fitting large data sets from electronic structure calculations. In this perspective, the central ideas underlying these ML potentials, solved problems and remaining challenges are reviewed along with a discussion of their current applicability and limitations.}

  pages = {957--967},
  abstract = {Most chemical processes on earth are intimately linked to the unique
	properties of water, relying on the versatility with which water
	interacts with molecules of varying sizes and polarities. These interactions
	determine everything from the structure and activity of proteins
	and living cells to the geological partitioning of water, oil, and
	minerals in the Earth's crust. The role of hydrophobic hydration
	in the formation of biological membranes and in protein folding,
	as well as the importance of electrostatic interactions in the hydration
	of polar and ionic species, are all well known. However, the underlying
	molecular mechanisms of hydration are often not as well understood.
	This Account summarizes and extends emerging understandings of these
	mechanisms to reveal a newly unified view of hydration and explain
	previously mystifying observations. For example, rare gas atoms (e.g.,
	Ar) and alkali-halide ions (e.g., K+ and Cl-) have nearly identical
	experimental hydration entropies, despite the significant charge-induced
	reorganization of water molecules. Here, we explain how such previously
	mysterious observations may be understood as arising from Gibbs inequalities,
	which impose rigorous energetic upper and lower bounds on both hydration
	free energies and entropies. These fundamental Gibbs bounds depend
	only on the average interaction energy of a solute with water, thus
	providing a deep link between solute-water interaction energies and
	entropies. One of the surprising consequences of the emerging picture
	is the understanding that the hydration of an ion produces two large
	but nearly perfectly canceling, entropic contributions: a negative
	ion-water interaction entropy and a positive water reorganization
	entropy. Recent work has also clarified the relationship between
	the strong cohesive energy of water and the free energy required
	to form an empty hole (cavity) in water. Here, we explain how linear
	response theory (whose roots may also be traced to Gibbs inequalities)
	can provide remarkably accurate descriptions of the process of filling
	aqueous cavities with nonpolar, polar, or charged molecules. The
	hydration of nonpolar molecules is well-described by first-order
	perturbation theory, which implies that turning on solute-water van
	der Waals interactions does not induce a significant change in water
	structure. The larger changes in water structure that are induced
	by polar and ionic solutes are well-described by second-order perturbation
	theory, which is equivalent to linear response theory. Comparisons
	of the free energies of nonpolar and polar or ionic solutes may be
	used to experimentally determine electrostatic contributions to water
	reorganization energies and entropies. The success of this approach
	implies that water's ability to respond to solutes of various polarities
	is far from saturated, as illustrated by simulations of acetonitrile
	(CH3CN) in water, which reveal that even such a strongly dipolar
	solute only produces subtle changes in the structure of water.},

Abstract = {{The systematic exploration of chemical compound space holds many
   promises toward structure-function relationships and material design. In
   the context of computer simulations, progress is hampered by both the
   sheer number of compounds and the efforts associated with parametrizing
   a force field for every new molecule. A coarse-grained (CG)
   representation provides not only a reduced phase space but also a
   smaller number of compounds, due to the redundancy of CG representations
   mapping to the same structure. Though many CG models require the
   explicit force-field parametrization of a molecule with all others,
   others assume transferability by means of mixing rules, such as the
   Martini force field. To alleviate the burden associated with tedious
   parametrizations for each new compound, the present work aims at
   automating the mapping and parametrization of common small organic
   molecules for Martini. We test the method by analyzing the water/octanol
   partitioning of more than 650 neutral molecules, the hydration free
   energy of 354 others, and the free energies of hydration and solvation
   in octanol of another 69 compounds. Last, we compare with all-atom
   simulations the thermodynamics of insertion of four individual solute
   molecules in a phospholipid membrane. The protocol demonstrates the
   feasibility of an automated parametrization scheme for Martini and
   provides prospects for high-throughput simulation methodologies.}},

abstract = {Classical intermolecular potentials typically require an extensive parametrization procedure for any new compound considered. To do away with prior parametrization, we propose a combination of physics-based potentials with machine learning (ML), coined IPML, which is transferable across small neutral organic and biologically relevant molecules. ML models provide on-the-fly predictions for environment-dependent local atomic properties: electrostatic multipole coefficients (significant error reduction compared to previously reported), the population and decay rate of valence atomic densities, and polarizabilities across conformations and chemical compositions of H, C, N, and O atoms. These parameters enable accurate calculations of intermolecular contributions—electrostatics, charge penetration, repulsion, induction/polarization, and many-body dispersion. Unlike other potentials, this model is transferable in its ability to handle new molecules and conformations without explicit prior parametrization: All local atomic properties are predicted from ML, leaving only eight global parameters—optimized once and for all across compounds. We validate IPML on various gas-phase dimers at and away from equilibrium separation, where we obtain mean absolute errors between 0.4 and 0.7 kcal/mol for several chemically and conformationally diverse datasets representative of non-covalent interactions in biologically relevant molecules. We further focus on hydrogen-bonded complexes—essential but challenging due to their directional nature—where datasets of DNA base pairs and amino acids yield an extremely encouraging 1.4 kcal/mol error. Finally, and as a first look, we consider IPML for denser systems: water clusters, supramolecular host-guest complexes, and the benzene crystal.

  abstract = {In principle, given the potential energy function, the values of thermodynamic
	variables can be computed from statistical mechanics for a system
	of molecules. In practice for the liquid state, however, two barriers
	must be overcome. This paper treats the first problem, how to quantum
	correct the classical mechanical thermodynamic values available from
	molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, perturbation, or integral methods
	in order to compare with experimental quantum reality. A subsequent
	paper will focus on the second difficulty, the effective computation
	of free energy and entropy. A simple technique, derived from spectral
	analysis of the atomic velocity time histories, is presented here
	for the frequency domain quantum correction of classical thermodynamic
	values. This technique is based on the approximation that potential
	anharmonicities mainly affect the lower frequencies in the velocity
	spectrum where the system behaves essentially classically, while
	the higher spectral frequencies, where the deviation from classical
	mechanics is most pronounced, involve sufficiently harmonic atomic
	motions that harmonic quantum corrections apply. Thus, a harmonic
	quantum correction can be applied at all frequencies: at low frequencies
	where it is inaccurate it will be small, while at high frequencies
	where it is large it will also be relatively accurate. The approach
	is demonstrated by computation of the energy and constant volume
	heat capacity for water from classical molecular dynamics followed
	by quantum correction. The potential used to describe the interactions
	of the system of water molecules includes internal vibrational degrees
	of freedom and thus strong quantum effects. Comparison of the quantum
	corrected theoretical values with experimental measurements shows
	good agreement. The quantum corrections to classical thermodynamics
	(which are also derived for free energy and entropy) are shown to
	be important not only for internal vibrational motion, but also for
	intermolecular hindered rotational and translational motions in liquid
	water. They are presumably also important for other strongly associated
	molecules, including bimolecules, and thus should be included when
	comparing calculated and measured thermodynamic quantities. The approach
	illustrated here allows the calculation of thermodynamic quantum
	corrections for liquids, solutions, and large molecules such as polymers
	(including proteins and nucleic acids) with full inclusion of both
	intra- and intermolecular degrees offreedom.}

abstract = {Motivated by the need for reliable experimental data for the assessment of theoretical predictions, this work proposes a data set of enthalpies of sublimation determined for specific crystalline structures, for the validation of molecular force fields (FF). The selected data were used to explore the ability of the OPLS-AA parametrization to investigate the properties of solid materials in molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, several approaches to improve this parametrization were also considered. These modifications consisted in replacing the original FF atomic point charges (APC), by values calculated using quantum chemical methods, and by the implementation of a polarizable FF. The obtained results indicated that, in general, the best agreement between theoretical and experimental data is found when the OPLS-AA force field is used with the original APC or when these are replaced by ChelpG charges, computed at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory, for isolated molecules in the gaseous phase. If a good description of the energetic relations between the polymorphs of a compound is required then either the use of polarizable FF or the use of charges determined taking into account the vicinity of the molecules in the crystal (combining the ChelpG and MP2/cc-pVDZ methods) is recommended. Finally, it was concluded that density functional theory methods, like B3LYP or B3PW91, are not advisable for the evaluation of APC of organic compounds for molecular dynamic simulations. Instead, the MP2 method should be considered.}

	the motion of the S4 helix, is a highly interesting and hotly debated
	topic in current membrane protein research. It has critical implications
	for insertion and stabilization of membrane proteins as well as for
	finding how transitions occur in membrane proteins-not to mention
	numerous applications in drug design. Here, we present a full 1 mu
	s atomic-detail molecular dynamics simulation of an integral Kv1.2
	ion channel, comprising 120,000 atoms. By applying 0.052 V/nm of
	hyperpolarization, we observe structural rearrangements, including
	up to 120 degrees rotation of the S4 segment, changes in hydrogen-bonding
	patterns, but only low amounts of translation. A smaller rotation
	(similar to 35 degrees) of the extracellular end of all S4 segments
	is present also in a reference 0.5 mu s simulation without applied
	field, which indicates that the crystal structure might be slightly
	different from the natural state of the voltage sensor. The conformation
	change upon hyperpolarization is closely coupled to an increase in
	3(10) helix contents in S4, starting from the intracellular side.
	This could support a model for transition from the crystal structure
	where the hyperpolarization destabilizes S4-lipid hydrogen bonds,
	which leads to the helix rotating to keep the arginine side chains
	away from the hydrophobic phase, and the driving force for final
	relaxation by downward translation is partly entropic, which would
	explain the slow process. The coordinates of the transmembrane part
	of the simulated channel actually stay closer to the recently determined
	higher-resolution Kv1.2 chimera channel than the starting structure
	for the entire second half of the simulation (0.5-1 mu s). Together
	with lipids binding in matching positions and significant thinning
	of the membrane also observed in experiments, this provides additional
	support for the predictive power of microsecond-scale membrane protein
	simulations.},

	with those used in G2 theory for molecules containing first-and second-row
	atoms, as well as the third-row elements Ga-Kr, have been derived.
	As for Ga-Kr, first-order spin-orbit corrections are included explicitly
	in the G2 energies of K-and Ca-containing atoms and molecules. In
	contrast to the procedure for Ga-Kr, the 3s and 3p orbitals need
	to be included in the cell-elation space for K-and Ca-containing
	molecules. The geometries obtained with the new basis sets are in
	satisfactory agreement with experiment. Assessment of the thermochemical
	predictions is limited because of the sparsity of accurate experimental
	data for molecules containing K and Ca, Ionization energies are generally
	in good agreement with experimental values, as are the atomization
	energies for K-containing molecules. However. there are larger differences

Abstract = {{An assimilated data base of total column ozone measurements from
   satellites has been used to generate a set of indicators describing
   attributes of the Antarctic ozone hole for the period 1979 to 2003,
   including (i) daily measures of the area over Antarctica where ozone
   levels are below 150 DU, below 220 DU, more than 30\% below 1979 to 1981
   norms, and more than 50\% below 1979 to 1981 norms, (ii) the date of
   disappearance of 150 DU ozone values, 220 DU ozone values, values 30\%
   below 1979 to 1981 norms, and values 50\% below 1979 to 1981 norms, for
   each year, (iii) daily minimum total column ozone values over
   Antarctica, and (iv) daily values of the ozone mass deficit based on a
   O-3< 220 DU threshold. The assimilated data base combines
   satellite-based ozone measurements from 4 Total Ozone Mapping
   Spectrometer ( TOMS) instruments, 3 different retrievals from the Global
   Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), and data from 4 Solar Backscatter
   UltraViolet (SBUV) instruments. Comparisons with the global ground-based
   Dobson spectrophotometer network are used to remove offsets and drifts
   between the different data sets to produce a global homogeneous data set
   that combines the advantages of good spatial coverage of satellite data
   with good long-term stability of ground-based measurements. One
   potential use of the derived indices is detection of the expected
   recovery of the Antarctic ozone hole. The suitability of the derived
   indicators to this task is discussed in the context of their variability
   and their susceptibility to saturation effects which makes them less
   responsive to decreasing stratospheric halogen loading. It is also shown
   that if the corrections required to match recent Earth Probe TOMS
   measurements to Dobson measurements are not applied, some of the
   indictors are affected so as to obscure detection of the recovery of the
   Antarctic ozone hole.}},

	W3 theory, as a successor to W1 and W2 theory proposed earlier {[}Martin
	and De Oliveira, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 1843 (1999)]. The new method
	is both more accurate overall (error statistics for total atomization
	energies approximately cut in half) and more robust (particularly
	towards systems exhibiting significant nondynamical correlation)
	than W2 theory. The cardinal improvement rests in an approximate
	account for post-CCSD(T) correlation effects. Iterative T-3 (connected
	triple excitations) effects exhibit a basis set convergence behavior
	similar to the T-3 contribution overall. They almost universally
	decrease molecular binding energies. Their inclusion in isolation
	yields less accurate results than CCSD(T) nearly across the board:
	It is only when T-4 (connected quadruple excitations) effects are
	included that superior performance is achieved. T-4 effects systematically
	increase molecular binding energies. Their basis set convergence
	is quite rapid, and even CCSDTQ/cc-pVDZ scaled by an empirical factor
	of 1.2532 will yield a quite passable quadruples contribution. The
	effect of still higher-order excitations was gauged for a subset
	of molecules (notably the eight-valence electron systems): T-5 (connected
	quintuple excitations) contributions reach 0.3 kcal/mol for the pathologically
	multireference X (1)Sigma(g)(+) state of C-2 but are quite small
	for other systems. A variety of avenues for achieving accuracy beyond
	that of W3 theory were explored, to no significant avail. W3 thus
	appears to represent a good compromise between accuracy and computational
	cost for those seeking a robust method for computational thermochemistry
	in the kJ/mol accuracy range on small systems. (C) 2004 American

The water-air interface is the most common and simple aqueous interface and serves as a model system for water at a hydrophobic surface. Unveiling the microscopic (<1 nm) structure and dynamics of interfacial water at the water-vapor interface is essential for understanding the processes occurring on the water surface. At the water interface the network of very strong intermolecular interactions, hydrogen-bonds, is interrupted and the density of water is reduced. A central question regarding water at interfaces is the extent to which the structure and dynamics of water molecules are influenced by the interruption of the hydrogen-bonded network and thus differ from those of bulk water. Herein, we discuss recent advances in the study of interfacial water at the water-air interface using laser-based surface-specific vibrational spectroscopy.}

	Gram-negative endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are enhanced by
	structurally diverse substances, such as anionic polysaccharides
	or cationic polypeptides. Only a few substances are known to effectively
	blunt LPS-induced monocyte activation. We now show that synthetic
	poly-L-histidine (Hn) binds to LPS and abrogates the release of the
	proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) in LPS-stimulated human
	whole blood. LPS-induced stimulation of monocytes was strictly pH-dependent
	with only minor amounts of IL-8 secreted in acidic blood. Maximum
	levels of IL-8 secretion occurred at a strongly basic pH. Hn inhibition
	of the release of IL-8 from LPS-stimulated monocytes was observed
	under acidic, neutral and physiological conditions. With increasing
	alkalosis, the effectiveness of Hn was gradually lost, suggesting
	that protonated, but not deprotonated, Hn was effective in inhibiting
	LPS-induced monocyte responses. Histidine-rich protein 2 from the
	malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, inhibited the ability of
	LPS to evoke an inflammatory response in CD14-transfected THP-1 cells.
	Further, a short synthetic peptide derived from human histidine-
	and proline-rich glycoprotein also exhibited LPS-inhibitory effects
	in CD14 transfectants. Taken together, these observations demonstrate
	the capacity of histidine-rich peptides, irrespective of their origin,
	to neutralize LPS-induced proinflammatory host responses. (C) 2003

	the majority of the computational workload involved in classical

	a new method for the parallelization of range-limited particle interactions
	that proves particularly suitable to MD applications. Because it
	applies not only to pairwise interactions but also to interactions
	involving three or more particles, the method can be used for evaluation
	of both nonbonded and bonded forces in a MD simulation. It requires
	less interprocessor data transfer than traditional spatial decomposition
	methods at all but the lowest levels of parallelism. It gains an
	additional practical advantage in certain commonly used interprocessor
	communication networks by distributing the communication burden more
	evenly across network links and by decreasing the associated latency.
	When used to parallelize MD, it further reduces communication requirements
	by allowing the computations associated with short-range nonbonded
	interactions, long-range electrostatics, bonded interactions, and
	particle migration to use much of the same communicated data. We
	also introduce certain variants of this method that can significantly
	improve the balance of computational load across processors. (c)

  abstract = {We present a combined experimental and modeling study of organic ligand
	molecules binding to a slightly polar engineered cavity site in T4
	lysozyme (L99A/M102Q). For modeling, we computed alchemical absolute
	binding free energies. These were blind tests performed prospectively
	on 13 diverse, previously untested candidate ligand molecules. We
	predicted that eight compounds would bind to the cavity and five
	would not; 11 of 13 predictions were correct at this level. The RMS
	error to the measurable absolute binding energies was 1.8 kcal/mol.
	In addition, we computed ``relative{''} binding free energies for
	six phenol derivatives starting from two known ligands: phenol and
	catechol. The average RMS error in the relative free energy prediction
	was 2.5 kcal/mol (phenol) and 1.1 kcal/mol (catechol). To understand
	these results at atomic resolution, we obtained x-ray co-complex
	structures for nine of the diverse ligands and for all six phenol
	analogs. The average RMSD of the predicted pose to the experiment
	was 2.0 angstrom (diverse set), 1.8 angstrom (phenol-derived predictions),
	and 1.2 angstrom (catechol-derived predictions). We found that predicting
	accurate affinities and rank-orderings required near-native starting
	orientations of the ligand in the binding site. Unanticipated binding
	modes, multiple ligand binding, and protein conformational change
	all proved challenging for the free energy methods. We believe that
	these results can help guide future improvements in physics-based
	absolute binding free energy methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

abstract = {The ambitious goal of organic crystal structure prediction challenges theoretical methods regarding their accuracy and efficiency. Dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) in principle is applicable, but the computational demands, for example, to compute a huge number of polymorphs, are too high. Here, we demonstrate that this task can be carried out by a dispersion-corrected density functional tight binding (DFTB) method. The semiempirical Hamiltonian with the D3 correction can accurately and efficiently model both solid- and gas-phase inter- and intramolecular interactions at a speed up of 2 orders of magnitude compared to DFT-D. The mean absolute deviations for interaction (lattice) energies for various databases are typically 2-3 kcal/mol (10-20%%), that is, only about two times larger than those for DFT-D. For zero-point phonon energies, small deviations of <0.5 kcal/mol compared to DFT-D are obtained.}

	to these drugs among circulating influenza viruses; however, their
	use is rising worldwide and drug resistance has been reported among
	influenza A (H5N1) viruses isolated from poultry and human beings
	in Asia. We sought to assess adamantane resistance among influenza
	A viruses isolated during the past decade from countries participating
	in WHO's global influenza surveillance network. Methods We analysed
	data for influenza field isolates that were obtained worldwide and
	submitted to the WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza at the US
	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between Oct 1, 1994, and
	Mar 31, 2005. We used pyrosequencing, confirmatory sequence analysis,
	and phenotypic testing to detect drug resistance among circulating
	influenza A H3N2 (n=6524), H1N1 (n=589), and H1N2 (n=83) viruses.
	Findings More than 7000 influenza A field isolates were screened
	for specific aminoacid substitutions in the M2 gene known to confer
	drug resistance. During the decade of surveillance a significant
	increase in drug resistance was noted, from 0.4\% in 1994-1995 to
	12.3\% in 2003-2004. This increase in the proportion of resistant
	viruses was weighted heavily by those obtained from Asia with 61\%
	of resistant viruses isolated since 2003 being from people in Asia.
	Interpretation Our data raise concerns about the appropriate use
	of adamantanes and draw attention to the importance of tracking the
	emergence and spread of drug-resistant influenza A viruses. 0140-6736}

abstract = { How are water’s material properties encoded within the structure of the water molecule? This is pertinent to understanding Earth’s living systems, its materials, its geochemistry and geophysics, and a broad spectrum of its industrial chemistry. Water has distinctive liquid and solid properties: It is highly cohesive. It has volumetric anomalies—water’s solid (ice) floats on its liquid; pressure can melt the solid rather than freezing the liquid; heating can shrink the liquid. It has more solid phases than other materials. Its supercooled liquid has divergent thermodynamic response functions. Its glassy state is neither fragile nor strong. Its component ions—hydroxide and protons—diffuse much faster than other ions. Aqueous solvation of ions or oils entails large entropies and heat capacities. We review how these properties are encoded within water’s molecular structure and energies, as understood from theories, simulations, and experiments. Like simpler liquids, water molecules are nearly spherical and interact with each other through van der Waals forces. Unlike simpler liquids, water’s orientation-dependent hydrogen bonding leads to open tetrahedral cage-like structuring that contributes to its remarkable volumetric and thermal properties. }

abstract = { The development of approximate exchange-correlation functionals is critical for modern density functional theory. A recent analysis of atomic systems suggested that some modern functionals are straying from the path toward the exact functional because electron densities are becoming less accurate while energies are becoming more accurate since the year 2000. To investigate this trend for more chemically relevant systems, the electron densities in the bonding regions and the atomization energies are analyzed for a series of diatomic molecules with 90 different functionals. For hybrid generalized gradient approximation functionals developed since the year 2000, the errors in densities and atomization energies are decoupled; the accuracy of the energies remains relatively consistent while the accuracy of the densities varies significantly. Such decoupling is not observed for generalized gradient and meta-generalized gradient approximation functionals. Analysis of electron densities in bonding regions is found to be important for the evaluation of functionals for chemical systems. }

	An extended Lagrangian treatment of the polarizable water, in which
	the water atomic charges fluctuate dynamically, is used to study
	the dynamics of F(H2O)(4)(-) cluster. A simulation using a fixed
	solvent charge distribution indicates principally interior, solvated
	states for the cluster. However, a preponderance of trisolvated configurations
	is observed using the polarizable model at 300 K, which involves
	only three direct fluoride-water hydrogen bonds. Ab initio calculations
	confirm this trisolvated species as a thermally accessible state
	at room temperature, in addition to the tetrasolvated interior and

	fluoride clusters with five and six waters gave less satisfactory
	agreement with experimental energies and with ab initio geometries.

	polarization is fundamental for an accurate understanding of the

The potentials of the nonrelativistic $^2\Sigma^+$ and $^2\Pi$ electronic states arising from the ground-state Br($^2P$)–Rg interactions are computed over a wide range of internuclear separations using a spin-restricted version of the coupled cluster method with single and double excitations and noniterative correction to triple excitations [RCCSD(T)] with an extrapolation to the complete basis set limit, from basis sets of d-aug-cc-pVQZ and d-aug-cc-pV5Z quality. These are compared with potentials derived previously from experimental measurements and ab initio calculations. The same approach is used also to refine the potentials of the Br$^-$–Rg anions obtained previously [Buchachenko et al., J. Chem. Phys. 125, 064305 (2006)]. Spin-orbit coupling in the neutral species is included both ab initio and via an atomic approximation; deviations between two approaches that are large enough to affect the results significantly are observed only in the Br–Xe and Br–Rn systems. The resulting relativistic potentials are used to compute anion zero electron kinetic energy photoelectron spectra, differential scattering cross sections, and the transport coefficients of trace amounts of both anionic and neutral bromine in the rare gases. Comparison with available experimental data for all systems considered proves a very high precision of the present potentials.}

abstract = { The electric quadrupole moment of a dipolar molecule depends upon the molecular origin from which it is measured. An electro-optical method has been successfully used for measuring the quadrupole moments of non-dipolar molecules, and the question arises: when the same method is applied to a dipolar substance what is the molecular origin to which the measured quadrupole moment should be referred? It is shown that this origin is not the centre of mass, but another point which may be called the ‘effective quadrupole centre’, the position of which depends in general on the wavelength of the light. Dipolar molecules experience a force in the field gradient and this enhances the contribution to the refractive index anisotropy from molecules which are out of line with the detector but in the light beam. This contribution is proportional to the dipole moment and is origin-dependent; it vanishes if the effective quadrupole centre is chosen as the origin. It is concluded that the electro-optical experiment should give identical quadrupoles for isotopically distinct species, and that the results for dipolar molecules may show an apparent dependence on the frequency of the light. The effects of distortion of the molecule by the field gradient are also considered. }

   the present study quantified the acute toxicity of two antibiotics
   (sulfadiazine and sulfadimidine), and three antiparasitic agents
   (flubendazole, fenbendazole, ivermectin) for nine freshwater
   invertebrate species. These experiments revealed a low degree of
   toxicity for the sulfonamide antibiotics, with limited implications in
   the survival of all test species at the highest test concentrations (50
   and 100 mg/L). In contrast, all three antiparasitic agents indicated on
   the basis of their acute toxicity risks for the aquatic environment.
   Moreover, chronic toxicity data from the literature for antiparasitics,
   including effects on reproduction in daphnids, support the concern about
   the integrity of aquatic ecosystems posed by releases of these
   compounds. Thus, these pharmaceuticals warrant further careful
   consideration by environmental risk managers.}},

	particle expressed in Escherichia coli, we have established conditions

	assembly is dependent on the presence of the coat protein (CP) N-terminal
	region, and in vitro assembly requires RNA. Using immobilised CP
	monomers under reassembly conditions with ``free{''} CP subunits,
	we have prepared a range of partially assembled CP species for RNA
	aptamer selection. SELEX directed against the RNA-binding face of
	the STNV CP resulted in the isolation of several clones, one of which
	(B3) matches the STNV-1 genome in 16 out of 25 nucleotide positions,
	including across a statistically significant 10/10 stretch. This
	10-base region folds into a stem loop displaying the motif ACAA and
	has been shown to bind to STNV CP. Analysis of the other aptamer
	sequences reveals that the majority can be folded into stem loops
	displaying versions of this motif. Using a sequence and secondary
	structure search motif to analyse the genomic sequence of STNV-1,
	we identified 30 stem loops displaying the sequence motif AxxA. The
	implication is that there are many stem loops in the genome carrying
	essential recognition features for binding STNV CP. Secondary structure
	predictions of the genomic RNA using Mfold showed that only 8 out
	of 30 of these stem loops would be formed in the lowest-energy structure.

BCI parameters are classified parsimoniously according to two atom types and the bond order. We show how BCIs may be fitted rapidly by linear least squares to the calculated ab initio electrostatic potential (ESP) or to the electrostatic field. When applied simultaneously to a set of compounds or conformations, the method yields consensus values of the BCIs. The method can also derive conventional "ESP-fit" atomic charges with improved numerical stability. The method may be generalized to determine atom multipoles, multicenter charge templates, or electronegativities, but not polarizability or hardness. We determine 65 potential-derived (PD) BCI parameters, which are classified as in MMFF, by fitting the 6-31G* ESP or the electrostatic field of the 45 compounds in the original MMFF94 training set. We compare the consensus BCIs with classified BCIs that were fit to each molecule individually and with "unique-bond" BCIs (ESP-derived atom charges). Consensus BCIs give a satisfactory representation for about half of the structures and are robust to the adjustment of the alkyl CH bond increment to the zero value employed in MMFF94. We highlight problems at three levels: Point approximation: the potential near lone pairs on sulfur and to some extent nitrogen cannot be represented just by atom charges. Bond classification: BCIs classified according to MMFF atom types cannot represent all delocalized electronic effects. The problem is especially severe for bonds between atoms of equivalent MMFF type, whose BCI must be taken as zero. Consensus: discrepancies that occur in forming the consensus across the training set indicate the need for a more detailed classification of BCIs. Contradictions are seen (e.g., between acetic acid and acetone and between guanidine and formaldehydeimine). We then test the three sets of PD-BCIs in energy minimizations of hydrogen-bonded dimers. Unique-bond BCIs used with the MMFF buffered 14-7 potential reproduce unscaled quantum chemical dimer interaction energies within 0.9 kcal/mol root mean square (or 0.5, omitting two N-oxides). These energies are on average 0.7 (or 0.5) kcal/mol too weak to reproduce the scaled quantum mechanical (SQM) results that are a benchmark for MMFF parameterization. Consensus BCIs tend to weaken the dimer energy by a further 0.4-0.6 kcal/mol. Thus, consensus PD-BCIs can serve as a starting point for MMFF parameterization, but they require both systematic and individual adjustments. Used with a "harder" AMBER-like Lennard-Jones potential, unique-bond PD-BCIs without systematic adjustment give dimer energies in fairly good agreement with SQM.}

	to an overall global cooling of the stratosphere in the simulations
	(0.59 +/- 6 0.07 K decade(-1) at 10 hPa), ozone recovery causes a
	warming of the Southern Hemisphere polar lower stratosphere in summer
	with enhanced cooling above. The rate of warming correlates with
	the rate of ozone recovery projected by the models and, on average,
	changes from 0.8 to 0.48 K decade(-1) at 100 hPa as the rate of recovery
	declines from the first to the second half of the century. In the
	winter northern polar lower stratosphere the increased radiative
	cooling from the growing abundance of GHGs is, in most models, balanced
	by adiabatic warming from stronger polar downwelling. In the Antarctic
	lower stratosphere the models simulate an increase in low temperature
	extremes required for polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) formation,
	but the positive trend is decreasing over the twenty-first century
	in all models. In the Arctic, none of the models simulates a statistically
	significant increase in Arctic PSCs throughout the twenty-first century.
	The subtropical jets accelerate in response to climate change and
	the ozone recovery produces a westward acceleration of the lower-stratospheric
	wind over the Antarctic during summer, though this response is sensitive
	to the rate of recovery projected by the models. There is a strengthening
	of the Brewer-Dobson circulation throughout the depth of the stratosphere,
	which reduces the mean age of air nearly everywhere at a rate of
	about 0.05 yr decade(-1) in those models with this diagnostic. On
	average, the annual mean tropical upwelling in the lower stratosphere
	(similar to 70 hPa) increases by almost 2\% decade(-1), with 59\%
	of this trend forced by the parameterized orographic gravity wave
	drag in the models. This is a consequence of the eastward acceleration
	of the subtropical jets, which increases the upward flux of (parameterized)
	momentum reaching the lower stratosphere in these latitudes.},

  abstract = {The random network model of water quantitatively describes the different
	hydration heat capacities of polar and apolar solutes in terms of
	distortions of the water-water hydrogen bonding angle in the first
	hydration shell (Gallagher and Sharp, JACS 2003;125:9853). The distribution
	of this angle in pure water is bimodal, with a low-angle population
	and high-angle population. Polar solutes increase the high-angle
	population while apolar solutes increase the low-angle population.
	The ratio of the two populations quantifies the hydrophobicity of
	the solute and provides a sensitive measure of water structural distortions.
	This method of analysis is applied to study hydration of type I thermal
	hysteresis protein (THP) from winter flounder and three quadruple
	mutants of four threonine residues at positions 2, 13, 24, and 35.
	Wild-type and two mutants (VVVV and AAAA) have antifreeze (thermal
	hysteresis) activity, while the other mutant (SSSS) has no activity.
	The analysis reveals significant differences in the hydration structure
	of the ice-binding site. For the SSSS mutant, polar groups have a
	typical polar-like hydration, that is, more high-angle H-bonds than
	bulk water. For the wildtype and active mutants, polar groups have
	unusual, very apolar-like hydration, that is, more low-angle H-bonds
	than bulk water. This pattern of hydration was seen previously in
	the structurally distinct type III THPs (Yang T Sharp Biophys Chem
	2004;109:137), suggesting for the first time a general mechanism
	for different THP classes. The specific shape, residue size, and
	clustering of both polar and apoler groups are essential for an active
	ice binding surface. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc. 0887-3585}

	higher energies in the mixture, reflecting hindrance of large amplitude
	proton motions. These results are compatible with computer simulations
	which predict longer hydrogen-bond lifetimes in the mixture, compared

	in the mixture are estimated to be \~{}1 ps, as for pure water. This
	experimental finding suggests that unlike in pure, low temperature
	water, proton librations should no longer be the main mechanism responsible
	for hydrogen-bond breaking in the mixture. Thus, the correspondence
	between the proton hindered rotational relaxation time and the ``hydrogen-bond
	lifetime'' should not apply in DMSO/water mixtures.}

Calculations are made using the cc-pCVnZ family of basis sets, with n = 2 to 5. In contrast with most quantum Monte Carlo works no re-optimization of the determinantal part in presence of a Jastrow is performed. For the largest cc-pCV5Z basis set the lowest upper bound for the ground-state energy reported so far of -76.437 44(18) is obtained. The fixed-node energy is found to decrease regularly as a function of the cardinal numbern and the Complete Basis Set limit associated with exact nodes is easily extracted. The resulting energy of -76.438 94(12) - in perfect agreement with the best experimentally derived value - is the most accurate theoretical estimate reported so far. We emphasize that employing selected configuration interactionnodes of increasing quality in a given family of basis sets may represent a simple, deterministic, reproducible, and systematic way of controlling the fixed-node error in diffusionMonte Carlo."

	Molecular dynamics simulations between 20 ns and 3 micros of clusters

	different models (SPC, TIP4P, and TIP5P) were used to simulate water,
	starting at temperatures of 250, 275, and 300 K. We monitored the
	temperature, the number of hydrogen bonds, the tetrahedral order,
	the evaporation, the radial distribution functions, and the diffusion
	coefficients. The three models behave very similarly as far as temperature
	and evaporation are concerned. Clusters starting at a higher temperature
	show a higher initial evaporation rate and therefore reach the point
	where evaporation stop (around 240 K) sooner. The radius of the clusters
	is decreased by 0.16-0.22 nm after 0.5 micros (larger clusters tend
	to decrease their radius slightly more), which corresponds to around
	one evaporated molecule per nm(2). The cluster temperature seems
	to converge towards 215 K independent of cluster size, when starting
	at 275 K. We observe only small structural changes, but the clusters
	modeled by TIP5P show a larger percentage of molecules with low diffusion
	coefficient as t->infinity, than those using the two other water
	models. TIP4P seems to be more structured and more hydrogen bonds
	are formed than in the other models as the temperature falls. The
	cooling rates are in good agreement with experimental results, and
	evaporation rates agree well with a phenomenological expression based

	by radiation damage. Traditional crystallography curbs the effects
	of damage by spreading damage over many copies of the molecule of
	interest in the crystal. X-ray lasers offer an additional opportunity
	for limiting damage by out-running damage processes with ultrashort
	and very intense X-ray pulses Such pulses may allow the imaging of

	Will also open up new avenues for structural studies on nano- and
	microcrystalline substances. This paper addresses the theoretical
	potentials and limitations of nanocrystallography with extremely
	intense coherent X-ray pulses. We use urea nanocrystals as a model
	for generic biological substances and simulate the primary and secondary
	ionization dynamics in the crystalline sample. The results establish
	conditions for ultrafast single shot nanocrystallography diffraction
	experiments as a function of X-ray fluence, pulse duration, and the
	size of nanocrystals. Nanocrystallography using ultrafast X-ray pulses
	has the potential to open up a new route in protein crystallography

  volume = {8},

  abstract = {The chemical composition of small organic molecules is often very
	similar to amino acid side chains or the bases in nucleic acids,
	and hence there is no a priori reason why a molecular mechanics force
	field could not describe both organic liquids and biomolecules with
	a single parameter set. Here, we devise a benchmark for force fields
	in order to test the ability of existing force fields to reproduce
	some key properties of organic liquids, namely, the density, enthalpy
	of vaporization, the surface tension, the heat capacity at constant
	volume and pressure, the isothermal compressibility, the volumetric
	expansion coefficient, and the static dielectric constant. Well over
	1200 experimental measurements were used for comparison to the simulations
	of 146 organic liquids. Novel polynomial interpolations of the dielectric
	constant (32 molecules), heat capacity at constant pressure (three
	molecules), and the isothermal compressibility (53 molecules) as
	a function of the temperature have been made, based on experimental
	data, in order to be able to compare simulation results to them.
	To compute the heat capacities, we applied the two phase thermodynamics
	method (Lin et al. J. Chem. Phys.2003, 119, 11792), which allows
	one to compute thermodynamic properties on the basis of the density
	of states as derived from the velocity autocorrelation function.
	The method is implemented in a new utility within the GROMACS molecular
	simulation package, named g\_dos, and a detailed expos\'{e} of the
	underlying equations is presented. The purpose of this work is to
	establish the state of the art of two popular force fields, OPLS/AA
	(all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulation) and GAFF (generalized
	Amber force field), to find common bottlenecks, i.e., particularly
	difficult molecules, and to serve as a reference point for future
	force field development. To make for a fair playing field, all molecules
	were evaluated with the same parameter settings, such as thermostats
	and barostats, treatment of electrostatic interactions, and system
	size (1000 molecules). The densities and enthalpy of vaporization
	from an independent data set based on simulations using the CHARMM
	General Force Field (CGenFF) presented by Vanommeslaeghe et al. (J.
	Comput. Chem., 2010, 31, 671) are included for comparison. We find
	that, overall, the OPLS/AA force field performs somewhat better than
	GAFF, but there are significant issues with reproduction of the surface
	tension and dielectric constants for both force fields.},

	measurements. However, closer values are found after reoptimizing
	the structures locally at more sophisticated levels, namely semi-empirical
	(PM6) and density-functional theory (B3LYP/6-31+G{*}). Upon heating
	the complexes, various indicators such as the heat capacity, number
	of hydrogen bonds or surface area provide evidence that the water
	cluster melts below 200 K but remains bonded to the AMP anion. The
	sequential loss of water molecules after sudden heating has been
	studied using a statistical approach in which unimolecular evaporation
	is described using the orbiting transition state version of phase
	space theory, together with anharmonic densities of vibrational states.
	The evaporation rates are calibrated based on the results of molecular
	dynamics trajectories at high internal energy. Our results indicate

  abstract = {Unimolecular evaporation of selected pure (H2O)(n) and heterogeneous
	(H2O)(n-1)X+ water clusters containing a single hydronium or ammonium
	impurity is investigated in the framework of phase space theory (PST)
	in its orbiting transition state version. Using the many-body polarizable
	Kozack-Jordan potential and its extensions for X+=H3O+ and NH4+,
	the thermal evaporation of clusters containing 21 and 50 molecules
	is simulated at several total energies. Numerous molecular dynamics
	(MD) trajectories at high internal energies provide estimates of
	the decay rate constant, as well as the kinetic energy and angular
	momentum released upon dissociation. Additional Monte Carlo simulations
	are carried out to determine the anharmonic densities of vibrational
	states, which combined with suitable forms for the rotational densities
	of states provide expressions for the energy-resolved differential
	rates. Successful comparison between the MD results and the independent
	predictions of PST for the distributions of kinetic energy and angular
	momentum released shows that the latter statistical approach is quantitative.
	Using MD data as a reference, the absolute evaporation rates are
	calculated from PST over broad energy and temperature ranges. Based
	on these results, the presence of an ionic impurity is generally
	found to decrease the rate, however the effect is much more significant
	in the 21-molecule clusters. Our calculations also suggest that due
	to backbendings in the microcanonical densities of states the variations
	of the evaporation rates may not be strictly increasing with energy
	or temperature.},

	sources. FP inhibits the enzymic activity of PfGAPDH with a K-i value
	of 0.2 muM, whereas red blood cell GAPDH is much less sensitive.
	By contrast, PfGR is more resistant to FP inhibition (K-i > 25 muM)
	than its human counterpart. We also examined the ability of FP to
	inhibit the activities of the additional antioxidant enzymes, P.
	falciparum thioredoxin reductase, which exhibits a K-i value of 1
	muM, and P. falciparum glutaredoxin, which shows more moderate sensitivity
	to FP. The exquisite sensitivity of PfGAPDH to FP may indicate that
	the glycolytic pathway of the parasite is particularly susceptible
	to modulation by FP stress. Inhibition of this pathway may drive
	flux through the pentose phosphate pathway ensuring sufficient production
	of reducing equivalents to counteract the oxidative stress induced
	by FP build-up. 0021-9258}

abstract ={We explore different schemes for improved accuracy of entropy calculations in aqueous liquid mixtures from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We build upon the two-phase thermodynamic (2PT) model of Lin et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 119, 11792 (2003)] and explore new ways to obtain the partition between the gas-like and solid-like parts of the density of states, as well as the effect of the chosen ideal “combinatorial” entropy of mixing, both of which have a large impact on the results. We also propose a first-order correction to the issue of kinetic energy transfer between degrees of freedom (DoF). This problem arises when the effective temperatures of translational, rotational, and vibrational DoF are not equal, either due to poor equilibration or reduced system size/time sampling, which are typical problems for ab initio MD. The new scheme enables improved convergence of the results with respect to configurational sampling, by up to one order of magnitude, for short MD runs. To ensure a meaningful assessment, we perform MD simulations of liquid mixtures of water with several other molecules of varying sizes: methanol, acetonitrile, N, N-dimethylformamide, and n-butanol. Our analysis shows that results in excellent agreement with experiment can be obtained with little computational effort for some systems. However, the ability of the 2PT method to succeed in these calculations is strongly influenced by the choice of force field, the fluidicity (hard-sphere) formalism employed to obtain the solid/gas partition, and the assumed combinatorial entropy of mixing. We tested two popular force fields, GAFF and OPLS with SPC/E water. For the mixtures studied, the GAFF force field seems to perform as a slightly better “all-around” force field when compared to OPLS+SPC/E.}

	challenge was to test the transferability of molecular simulation
	methods and intermolecular potentials (force fields) when applied
	to a wide variety of physical properties for a given industrially
	relevant small molecule. Force field parameters are often developed
	for, tested with, and applied to a relatively limited range property
	types. Methods that are able to predict a broad range of properties
	may be more useful for practical application in an industrial setting.
	To address this primary goal, entrants were challenged to develop
	new intermolecular potential models for ethylene oxide (EO) and to
	us they predict a variety of physical properties. The predictions
	were judged by comparison to a set of benchmark values established
	based on peer-reviewed scientific literature and highly regarded
	property databases, and the results were generally excellent. A secondary
	objective was to assess the variability of those property predictions
	when performed by different researchers using the same force field
	(a ``round-robin{''} experiment). To address this goal, entrants
	were challenged to calculate the same set of properties for a specific
	EO potential model from the literature, and good consistency was
	found between the predictions of most of the entrants. (c) 2008 Elsevier

  abstract = {The evolution of the Earth's atmosphere is essentially the story of
	atmospheric oxygen. Virtually every realm of the Earth sciences-biology,
	geology, geochemistry, oceanography and atmospheric science-is needed
	to piece together an understanding of the history of oxygen. Over
	the past decade, new data from these fields has shown that there
	were two significant increases in atmospheric O-2 levels at around
	2.4-2.3 and 0.8-0.6 billion years ago, respectively. Throughout Earth
	history, oceanic sulfate concentrations appear to have increased
	in accord with greater O-2 evels, while levels of methane, a strong
	greenhouse gas, may have inversely mirrored O-2. Both oxic transitions
	occurred in eras characterized by ``Snowball Earth{''} events and
	significant disturbances in the carbon cycle, perhaps associated
	with increases in O-2 and losses of methane. To understand what controlled
	the oxygenation of the atmosphere, it is necessary to determine how
	O-2 is consumed on geologic time scales through reaction with reductants
	released from the Earth's crust and mantle. There was apparently
	a long delay between the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis and
	oxygenation of the atmosphere, and a plausible explanation is that
	excess reductants scavenged photosynthetic O-2 from the early atmosphere.
	However, a quantitative understanding of how and why O-2 became abundant
	on our reducing planet is still lacking. Thus, the study of the early
	atmosphere remains a frontier field with much to be discovered. (c)

They have used theoretical estimates of the repulsive part of the second-neighbour interaction and added a variable attractive part to fit the crystal data.

This review highlights the recent significant developments in the experiment, theory, and simulation of nuclear quantum effects in water. Novel experimental techniques, such as deep inelastic neutron scattering, now provide a detailed view of the role of nuclear quantum effects in water's properties. These have been combined with theoretical developments such as the introduction of the principle of competing quantum effects that allows the subtle interplay of water's quantum effects and their manifestation in experimental observables to be explained. We discuss how this principle has recently been used to explain the apparent dichotomy in water's isotope effects, which can range from very large to almost nonexistent depending on the property and conditions. We then review the latest major developments in simulation algorithms and theory that have enabled the efficient inclusion of nuclear quantum effects in molecular simulations, permitting their combination with on-the-fly evaluation of the potential energy surface using electronic structure theory. Finally, we identify current challenges and future opportunities in this area of research. }

	offer unique opportunities to study fundamental aspects of complex

	usually require highly synchronized pulses to initiate a transition
	and then probe it after a precisely defined time delay. In the X-ray
	regime, these methods are challenging because they require complex
	optical systems and diagnostics. Here we propose and apply a simple
	holographic measurement scheme, inspired by Newton's 'dusty mirror'
	experiment(1), to monitor the X-ray-induced explosion of microscopic
	objects. The sample is placed near an X-ray mirror; after the pulse
	traverses the sample, triggering the reaction, it is reflected back
	onto the sample by the mirror to probe this reaction. The delay is
	encoded in the resulting diffraction pattern to an accuracy of one
	femtosecond, and the structural change is holographically recorded
	with high resolution. We apply the technique to monitor the dynamics
	of polystyrene spheres in intense free-electron-laser pulses, and
	observe an explosion occurring well after the initial pulse. Our
	results support the notion that X-ray flash imaging(2,3) can be used
	to achieve high resolution, beyond radiation damage limits for biological
	samples(4). With upcoming ultrafast X-ray sources we will be able
	to explore the three-dimensional dynamics of materials at the time-scale

	the enthalpy, temperature, density, pressure, and the reaction time

	conditions (30 kbar, 1750 K, density similar to 1 g/cm(3)) present
	during the lifetime of the filament (20-30 ns) were extreme and provided
	a unique environment for high-temperature water chemistry. For the
	probe of the reaction products liquid beam desorption mass spectrometry
	was employed. A decisive feature of the technique is that ionic species,
	as well as neutral products and intermediates may be detected (neutrals
	as protonated aggregates) via time-of-flight mass spectrometry without
	any additional ionization laser. After the explosive disintegration
	of the superheated beam, high-temperature water reactions are efficiently
	quenched via expansion and evaporative cooling. For first exploratory

	It has been used in the past to directly isolate charged molecular
	aggregates from the liquid phase and to determine their molecular
	weight employing sensitive time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The
	liquid matrix in this MALDI (matrix assisted laser desorption and
	ionization) type approach consists of a 10 mu m diameter free liquid
	filament in vacuum (or a free droplet) which is excited with a focused
	infrared laser pulse tuned to match the absorption frequency of the
	OH-stretch vibration of bulk water near 2.8 mu m. Due to these features
	we will refer to the approach as free liquid matrix assisted laser
	dispersion of ions or ionic aggregates (IR-FL-MALDI), although also
	LILBID ("laser induced liquid beam (bead) desorption and ionization")
	has been proposed early as a descriptive acronym for the technique
	and may be used alternatively. Low-charge-state macromolecular adducts
	are isolated in the gas phase from solution via a yet poorly characterized
	mechanism which sensitively depends upon the laser intensity and
	wavelength, and after the gentle liquid-to-vacuum transfer the aggregates
	are analyzed via time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Possible
	mechanisms for the isolation and charging of biomolecules directly
	from liquid solution are discussed in the present contribution. Recent
	technical advances such as minimizing the sample consumption, strategies
	for high throughput mass spectrometry, and coupling of liquid beam
	MS with HPLC will be highlighted as well. An interesting feature
	of IR-FL-MALDI is what we call the linear response, i.e., a surprising
	linearity of the gas phase mass signal on the solution concentration
	over many orders of magnitude for a large number of biomolecular
	systems as well as ions. Due to these features the approach may be
	regarded as a true solution probing spectroscopy, which enables elegant
	biokinetic studies. Several experiments in which time resolved IR-FL-MALDI-MS
	has recently been employed successfully are given. A particular highlight
	is the possibility to quantitatively detect oxidation states in solution,
	which clearly distinguishes the present approach from other established
	MS source concepts. Due to the good matrix tolerance also proteins
	in complex mixtures can be monitored quantitatively. 1463-9076}

The polarizabilities thus obtained for dimers are then used to evaluate the magnitudes of polarization energies and van der Waals dipole–dipole energies. For describing the overlap repulsive potential we have adopted two forms: (i) the revised version of the Born–Mayer potential and (ii) the Harrison form for the overlap repulsive energy. These potentials have been used to obtain the binding energies of monomers as well as dimers, spectroscopic constants of monomers, equilibrium geometries of dimers, and dimerization energies. The results have been discussed and compared with available experimental data.}

	of uniaxial strain but three-dimensional stress. Two potential material
	removal mechanisms, thermal (melting) and non-thermal (high stress),
	are identified. Numerical results show that the non-thermal damage
	could be a dominating mechanism in ultrashort laser-material ablation.
	The major driving force for the non-thermal damage is the so-called
	hot-electron blast force, which is generated by non-equilibrium hot
	electrons. It is also found that for gold films thicker than 200
	nm, a thin layer of material near the heated surface could be removed,
	as experimentally observed (Opt. Cummun. 129 (1996) 134; J. Appl.
	Phys. 85 (1999) 6803). On the other hand, damage could initiate from
	the middle region and then extend over the entire film for a gold
	film of 50 nm in thickness or thinner. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

	Our analysis shows that the choice of grid mesh size influences the

	coordinated) atoms. We find that a maximum grid spacing of 0.2-0.3
	\AA is required to obtain reliable atomic charges. The effect of
	the exclusion radius for point selection is assessed; we find that
	the common choice of using the van der Waals (vdW) radius as the
	exclusion radius for each atom may result in large deviations between
	the ESP generated from the ab initio calculations and that computed
	from the fitted charges, especially for points closest to the exclusion
	radii. We find that a larger value of exclusion radius than commonly

With two flexible SPC/E models, our investigations include three aspects about their INM spectra, which are separated into the unstable, intermolecular, bending, and stretching bands. First, the O- and H-atom contributions in the four INM bands are calculated and their stable INM spectra are compared with the power spectra of the atomic velocity autocorrelation functions. The unstable and intermolecular bands of the flexible models are also compared with those of the SPC/E model of rigid molecules. Second, we formulate the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of the INMs, respectively, for the O- and H-atom and molecule. With the IPRs, the numbers of the three species participated in the INMs are estimated so that the localization characters of the INMs in each band are studied. Further, by the ratio of the IPR of the H atom to that of the O atom, we explore the number of involved OH bond per molecule participated in the INMs. Third, by classifying simulated molecules into subensembles according to the geometry of their local environments or their H-bond configurations, we examine the local-structure effects on the bending and stretching INM bands. All of our results are verified to be insensible to the definition of H-bond. Our conclusions about the intermolecular and intramolecular vibrations in water are given."

We demonstrate that a fully ab initio approach, relying on the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional, provides such a description of water. SCAN accurately describes the balance among covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions that dictates the structure and dynamics of liquid water. Notably, SCAN captures the density difference between water and ice Ih at ambient conditions, as well as many important structural, electronic, and dynamic properties of liquid water. These successful predictions of the versatile SCAN functional open the gates to study complex processes in aqueous phase chemistry and the interactions of water with other materials in an efficient, accurate, and predictive, ab initio manner.},

	The method is based on a constrained minimization of the difference

	chosen in a way that best reflects the key conformational changes.
	It was demonstrated that such an approach improves the predictive
	ability of EP models. It also allows to exploit equivalence of atoms
	in the calculation of multipoles components. In the case of polar

Traditional practice in simulation data analysis recommends this initial portion be discarded to equilibration, but no simple, general, and automated procedure for this process exists. Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data. }

	approach for deriving charges for nucleosides and nucleotides involves
	allowing only C1' and H1' of the sugar to vary as the nucleic acid
	base, with the remainder of sugar and backbone atoms forced to be
	equivalent. For peptide fragments, we have combined multiple conformation
	fitting, previously employed by Williams(3) and Reynolds et al.,(4)
	with the RESP approach(1,2) to derive charges for blocked dipeptides
	appropriate for each of the 20 naturally occuring amino acids. Based
	on our results for propyl amine,(1,2) we suggest that two conformations
	for each peptide suffice to give charges that represent well the
	conformationally dependent electrostatic properties of molecules,
	provided that these two conformations contain different values of
	the dihedral angles that terminate in heteroatoms or hydrogens attached
	to heteroatoms. In these blocked dipeptide models, it is useful to
	require equivalent N-H and C=O charges for all amino acids with a
	given net charge (except proline), and this is accomplished in a
	straightforward fashion with multiple-molecule fitting. Finally,
	the application of multiple Lagrangian constraints allows for the
	derivation of monomeric residues, with the appropriate net charge
	from a chemically blocked version of the residue. The multiple Lagrange
	constraints also enable charges from two or more molecules to be
	spliced together in a well-defined fashion. Thus, the combined use
	of multiple molecules, multiple conformations, multiple Lagrangian
	constraints, and RESP fitting is shown to be a powerful approach
	to deriving electrostatic charges for biopolymers. (C) 1995 by John

The empirical functional form of classical fixed-charge force fields dates back to 1969 and remains essentially unchanged. In a fixed-charge force field, the polarization is not modeled explicitly, i.e. the effective partial charges do not change depending on conformation and environment. This simplification allows, however, a dramatic reduction in computational cost compared to polarizable force fields and in particular quantum-chemical modeling. The past decades have shown that simulations employing carefully parametrized fixed-charge force fields can provide useful insights into biological and chemical questions. This overview focuses on the four major force-field families, i.e. AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS, and OPLS, which are based on the same classical functional form and are continuously improved to the present day. The overview is aimed at readers entering the field of (bio)molecular simulations. More experienced users may find the comparison and historical development of the force-field families interesting.}

	However, similar effects arise quite generally in order\%G--\%@disorder
	transitions in homogeneous systems, particularly those comprising
	hydrogen-bonded networks, and this may have significance for our
	understanding of protein folding and other biomolecular processes.
	The positive DeltaCp associated with unfolding of globular proteins in
	water, thought to be due to hydrophobic interactions, is also typical
	of the values found for the melting of crystalline solids, where
	the effect is greatest for the melting of polar compounds, including
	pure water. This suggests an alternative model of protein folding
	based on the thermodynamics of phase transitions in hydrogen-bonded
	networks. Folded proteins may be viewed as islands of cooperatively-ordered
	hydrogen-bonded structure, floating in an aqueous network of less-well-ordered
	H-bonds in which the degree of hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing
	temperature. The enthalpy of melting of the protein consequently
	increases with temperature. A simple algebraic model, based on the
	overall number of protein and solvent hydrogen bonds in folded and
	unfolded states, shows how DeltaCp from this source could match the hydrophobic
	contribution. This confirms the growing view that the thermodynamics
	of protein folding, and other interactions in aqueous systems, are
	best described in terms of a mixture of polar and non-polar effects
	in which no one contribution is necessarily dominant.}

	water molecules were calculated to contribute around 25\% of the
	total calculated binding strength. Theoretical alanine mutations

	correlations were observed between the calculated changes in binding

Significant improvements over previous work have been made to the mathematical models for these functions, particularly with respect to the behavior of the potential energy in the long-range region where dispersion forces between the component atoms dominate. The {MLR3} model for the potential energy is employed, allowing for constraint of the three leading dispersion coefficients C6, C8, and C10, for the X states of {HF} and HCl. Quantum-mechanical rotational and centrifugal distortion constants are calculated for all isotopologues considered in the non-linear least-squares fitting procedures. Computer code is provided in order that precise calculation of all functions for all isotopologues is possible for a user-specified radial grid. Precise estimates are obtained for X state equilibrium internuclear separations for the principal isotopologues of all four halides, namely re(HF)=0.91683897+/-0.00000004{\AA}, re(H35Cl)=1.27454677+/-0.00000006{\AA}, re(H79Br)=1.4144292+/-0.0000001{\AA}, and re(HI)=1.6290588 +/- 0.0000004{\AA}."

	They can be inferred from experimental data by complicated inverse
	procedures which often rely on several assumptions, including the
	Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Theory provides a direct route to
	equilibrium geometries. A recent high-quality {$\backslash$it ab
	initio} semiglobal adiabatic potential-energy surface (PES) of the

	determined by analyzing experimental data. Detailed investigation
	of the effect of the breakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation
	suggests that the concept of an isotope-independent equilibrium structure
	holds to about 3 $\backslash$times 10\^{}{-5} \AA and 0.02\^{}O
	for water. The mass-independent [Born-Oppenheimer (BO)] equilibrium
	bond length and bond angle on the ground electronic state PES of
	water is r\_e\^{}{BO}=0.957 82 \AA and $\theta$\_e\^{}{BO}=104.48\_5\^{}o,

	levels on the vibrational ground state by the CVRQD PESs is accurate
	to better than 0.002 cm\^{}{-1} for all isotopologs of water considered.
	Elaborate adjustment of the CVRQD PESs to reproduce all observed
	rovibrational transitions to better than 0.05 cm\^{}{-1} (or the
	lower ones to better than 0.0035 cm\^{}{-1}) does not result in

	The expectation values of the ground vibrational state rotational
	constants of the water isotopologs, computed in the Eckart frame
	using the CVRQD PESs and atomic masses, deviate from the experimentally
	measured ones only marginally, especially for A\_0 and B\_0. The
	small residual deviations in the effective rotational constants are
	due to centrifugal distortion, electronic, and non-Born-Oppenheimer
	effects. The spectroscopic (nonadiabatic) equilibrium structural
	parameters of H\_2 \^{}{16}O, obtained from experimentally determined
	A'\_0 and B'\_0 rotational constants corrected empirically to obtain

  abstract = {Many bioprocess separations involve manipulating the solution conditions
	to selectively remove or concentrate a target protein. The selectivity
	is determined by the thermodynamics of the protein solution, which
	are governed, at the molecular level, by protein-protein interactions.
	Thus, to optimise these processes, one must understand the precise
	nature of these interactions, how they are affected by the control
	parameters (e.g., temperature, ionic strength, pH), and how they
	relate to the solution properties of interest (e.g., protein solubility,
	protein stability, crystal nucleation rates). Recently, studies of
	protein-protein interactions have been motivated by the discovery
	of a crystallisation window, which places bounds on the protein-protein
	attraction that is required for crystallisation to be possible. This
	review focuses on experimental and theoretical studies of protein-protein
	interactions and discusses the current caps in understanding these
	forces. The first models for these interactions had been based on
	DLVO theory, which has proven useful for understanding protein-protein
	interactions in dilute electrolyte solutions. However, DLVO theory
	does not include such important effects as anisotropic interactions,
	solvation forces, and specific ion effects. Various approaches have
	been developed to include these phenomena although they are still
	not well understood. One outstanding issue concerns specific ion
	effects, which play a crucial role in biological systems. An initial
	step in understanding these effects might be to first rationalize
	protein-salt interactions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All fights reserved.

Extension of G3 theory in this manner, referred to as G3X, is found to give significantly better agreement with experiment for the G3/99 test set of 376 reaction energies. Overall the mean absolute deviation from experiment decreases from 1.07 kcal/mol G3 to 0.95 kcal/mol G3X. The largest improvement occurs for nonhydrogens. In this subset of energies the mean absolute deviation from experiment decreases from 2.11 to 1.49 kcal/mol. The increased accuracy is due to both the use of new geometries and the larger Hartree-Fock basis set. In addition, five other G3 methods are modified to incorporate these new features.

	the solvation shell from the bulk. In general, most of the cationic

	ions and because the water molecule dipole vector is oriented to
	the cation's center. On the other hand, the anionic aqueous solvation
	shells are complex structures due to the larger size of the anions

	molecules. In addition to obtaining good agreement with the experimental
	enthalpies, the calculated Na+-oxygen radial distribution function
	(RDF) for the Na+ (H2O)6 cluster displays two distinguishable zones;
	integrating over the first zone yields four water molecules, and
	the remaining two water molecules belong the second zone. In contrast
	to the structure of the Na+ complex with four water molecules, the
	four water molecules around the Cl- ion in Cl- (H2O)4 are found clustered
	together in one hemisphere of the ion. These waters form weak hydrogen
	bonds with each other, resulting in an average water-water binding
	energy of -4.6 kcal/mol. These results indicate that the stability
	of the Cl-(H2O)4 complex arises in part from water-water binding.
	The coordination number of the Na+ and Cl- ions obtained from ionic

	and the binding energies for these clusters are in reasonable agreement
	with accurate electronic structure calculations. The model predicts
	that the water trimer, tetramer, and pentamer have cyclic planar
	minimum energy structures. A prismlike structure is predicted to
	be lowest in energy for the water hexamer, and a cagelike structure
	is the second lowest in energy, with an energy of about 0.2 kcal/mol
	higher than the prismlike structure. The results are consistent with
	recent quantum Monte Carlo simulations as well as electronic structure
	calculations. The computed thermodynamic properties for the model,
	at room temperature, including the liquid density, the enthalpy of
	vaporization, as well as the diffusion coefficient, are in excellent
	agreement with experimental values. Structural properties of liquid

	results are consistent with those reported in earlier work on the
	same systems. The calculated surface tension at room temperature
	is in reasonable agreement with the corresponding experimental data.
	As expected, the computed average dipole moments of water molecules
	near the interface are close to their gas phase values, while water

The behaviour of the frequency dependent absorption coefficient (alpha), refractive index (n) and the dielectric relaxation response time (tau), obtained by fitting both real and imaginary parts of the permittivity (epsilon) using a triple Debye relaxation model are studied. The timescales obtained for bulk water are of the order of~ 9 ps, 200 fs and 80 fs. The relaxation time constant in the presence of the salt shows an accelerated reorientation dynamics of the water dipoles, which, in turn renders an indirect support for the 'water structure breaking' ability of monovalent ions, the effect being ion specific. We have also studied the effect of these ions on the secondary structure as well as hydration dynamics around a model protein bovine serum albumin (BSA). It is found that the structure and hydration of the protein as well as the salt hydration suffer negligible perturbation in the presence of the alkali metal chlorides. "

Abstract = {{We study the unbiased folding/unfolding thermodynamics of the Trp-cage
   miniprotein using detailed molecular dynamics simulations of an all-atom
   model of the protein in explicit solvent using the Amberff99SB force
   field. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations are used to
   sample the protein ensembles over a broad range of temperatures covering
   the folded and unfolded states at two densities. The obtained ensembles
   are shown to reach equilibrium in the 1 mu s/replica timescale. The
   total simulation time used in the calculations exceeds 100 mu s.
   Ensemble averages of the fraction folded, pressure, and energy
   differences between the folded and unfolded states as a function of
   temperature are used to model the free energy of the folding transition,
   Delta G(P, T), over the whole region of temperatures and pressures
   sampled in the simulations. The Delta G(P, T) diagram describes an
   ellipse over the range of temperatures and pressures sampled, predicting
   that the system can undergo pressure-induced unfolding and cold
   denaturation at low temperatures and high pressures, and unfolding at
   low pressures and high temperatures. The calculated free energy function
   exhibits remarkably good agreement with the experimental folding
   transition temperature (T(f) = 321 K), free energy, and specific heat
   changes. However, changes in enthalpy and entropy are significantly
   different than the experimental values. We speculate that these
   differences may be due to the simplicity of the semiempirical force
   field used in the simulations and that more elaborate force fields may
   be required to describe appropriately the thermodynamics of proteins.}},

	quantum mechanically. We found that the hydrophobic side chain (R
	= CH3) defines the trajectory path of the molecule. Initially fully
	hydrated in an isolated droplet of water, the amino acid moves to
	the droplet's surface, exposing its hydrophobic methyl group and
	alpha-hydrogen out of the water. The structure of an L-alanine with
	the methyl group exposed to the water surface was found to be energetically
	favorable compared to a fully hydrated molecule. The dynamic behavior
	of the system suggests that the first hydration shell of the amino
	acid is localized around carboxylate (CO2-) and ammonium (NH3+) functional
	groups; it is highly ordered and quite rigid. In contrast, the hydration
	shell around the side chain is much less structured, suggesting a
	modest influence of the methyl group on the structure of water. The
	number of water molecules in the first hydration shell of an alanine
	molecule is constantly changing; the average number was found to
	equal 7. The molecular dynamics results show that L-alanine in water
	does not have a preferred conformation, as all three of the molecule's
	functional sites (i.e., CH3, NH3+, CO2-) perform rotational movements
	around the C-alpha-site bond. 1520-6106}

abstract = {Fully a priori predictions are reported for the vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) properties of Ar, Kr, and Xe using molecular simulation techniques and recently developed ab initio two-body interatomic potentials. Simulation data are reported at temperatures from near the triple point to close to the critical point. The two-body ab initio potentials exaggerate the size of the experimental VLE temperature-density envelope, overestimating the critical temperature and underestimating the vapor pressure. These deficiencies can be partially rectified by the addition of a density-dependent three-body term. At many temperatures, the ab initio + three-body simulations for Kr and Xe predict the vapor pressure to an accuracy that is close to experimental uncertainty. The predicted VLE coexisting densities for Xe almost match experimental data. The improvement with experiment is also reflected in more accurate enthalpies of vaporization. The fully a priori predictions for all of the VLE properties of either Kr or Xe are noticeably superior to simulations using the Lennard-Jones potential.

	longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates was measured over the
	Larmor frequency range 2.6 to 49 MHz in the pD range 2 to 11 at 27
	degrees C. While the protein-induced relaxation enhancement was similar
	for the two proteins at high frequencies, it was an order of magnitude
	smaller for ubiquitin than for BPTI at low frequencies. This difference
	was ascribed to the abscence, in ubiquitin, of highly ordered internal
	water molecules, which are known to be present in BPTI and in most
	other globular proteins. These observations demonstrate that the
	water relaxation dispersion in protein solutions is essentially due
	to a few structural water molecules buried within the protein matrix,
	but exchanging rapidly with the external water. The relaxation data
	indicate that the internal water molecules of BPTI exchange with
	bulk water on the time-scale 10(-8) to 10(-6) second thus lowering
	the recently reported upper bound on the residence time of these
	internal water molecules by four orders of magnitude, and implying
	that local unfolding occurs on the submicrosecond time-scale. The
	water molecules residing at the surface of the two proteins were
	found to be highly mobile, with an average rotational correlation
	time of approximately 20 picoseconds. For both proteins, the oxygen-17
	relaxation depended only very weakly on pD, showing that ionic residues
	do not perturb hydration water dynamics more than other surface residues.
	We believe that the present results resolve the long-standing controversy
	regarding the mechanism behind the spin relaxation dispersion of
	water nuclei in protein solutions, thus establishing oxygen-17 relaxation
	as a powerful tool for studies of structurally and functionally important
	water molecules in proteins and other biomolecules.},

  abstract = {A general methodology for deriving geometry-dependent atomic charges
	is presented. The main ingredient of the method is a model that describes
	the molecular dipole moment in terms of geometry-dependent point
	charges. The parameters of the model are determined from ab initio
	calculations of molecular dipole moments and their Cartesian derivatives
	at various molecular geometries. Transferability of the parameters
	is built into the model by fitting ab initio calculations for various
	molecules simultaneously. The results show that charge flux along
	the bonds is a major contributing factor to the geometry dependence
	of the atomic charges, with additional contributions from fluxes
	along valence angles and adjacent bonds. Torsion flux is found to
	be smaller in magnitude than the bond and valence angle fluxes but
	is not always unimportant. A set of electrostatic parameters is presented
	for alkanes, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Transferability of these
	parameters for a host of molecules is established to within 3-5\%
	error in the predicted dipole moments. A possible extension of the

In this work, ab initio molecular dynamics employing periodic boundary conditions are used to simulate its structure and Raman scattering. Fused silica geometry is modeled as a frozen liquid, and the spectra are compared to those of crystal quartz. The method is tested also on Raman spectra of liquid water. Structural similarities between water and fused silica are discussed. The modeling agrees with experiment and suggests that most fused silica spectral features can be explained within the harmonic approximation. The combination of Raman spectroscopy with theoretical computations thus appears useful for structural studies of amorphous materials. "

  abstract = {Background: Three complete genomes of Prochlorococcus species, the
	smallest and most abundant photosynthetic organism in the ocean,
	have recently been published. Comparative genome analyses reveal
	that genome shrinkage has occurred within this genus, associated
	with a sharp reduction in G+C content. As all examples of genome
	reduction characterized so far have been restricted to endosymbionts
	or pathogens, with a host-dependent lifestyle, the observed genome
	reduction in Prochlorococcus is the first documented example of such
	a process in a free-living organism. Results: Our results clearly
	indicate that genome reduction has been accompanied by an increased
	rate of protein evolution in P. marinus SS120 that is even more pronounced
	in P. marinus MED4. This acceleration has affected every functional
	category of protein-coding genes. In contrast, the 16S rRNA gene
	seems to have evolved clock-like in this genus. We observed that
	MED4 and SS120 have lost several DNA-repair genes, the absence of
	which could be related to the mutational bias and the acceleration
	of amino-acid substitution. Conclusions: We have examined the evolutionary
	mechanisms involved in this process, which are different from those
	known from host-dependent organisms. Indeed, most substitutions that
	have occurred in Prochlorococcus have to be selectively neutral,
	as the large size of populations imposes low genetic drift and strong
	purifying selection. We assume that the major driving force behind
	genome reduction within the Prochlorococcus radiation has been a
	selective process favoring the adaptation of this organism to its
	environment. A scenario is proposed for genome evolution in this
	genus.},

  abstract = { Explaining and predicting the distribution of ions at the air-water interface has been a central challenge of physical chemistry for nearly a century. In essence, the problem amounts to calculating the change in the solvation energy of an ion as it approaches the interface. Here, we generalize our recently developed model of ionic solvation energies to calculate this interaction. The change in the Born energy as well as the static polarization response of the ion is included by using the conductor-like screening model (COSMO), which treats the ions quantum mechanically. Approximate expressions for the dispersion repulsion, cavity attraction, and surface potential contributions are also included. This model reproduces the surface tensions of electrolyte solutions and is consistent with ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The model provides clear physical insight into iodide's adsorption. Unlike alternative models, no parameters are deliberately adjusted to reproduce surface tensions, and all of the important contributions to the interactions are included. Solving this problem has important direct implications for atmospheric chemistry and bubble properties. It also has important indirect implications for the more complex interactions of ions with protein and mineral surfaces. These play a fundamental role in a vast number of biological and industrial processes. The model is conceptually simple and has low computational demand, which facilitates its extension to these important applications. }

Here we explore what insights can be gained from a continuum solvent model. We extend our model of ionic solvation free energies and surface interaction free energies to include hydronium and hydroxide. The hydronium cation is attracted to the air-water interface, whereas the hydroxide anion is repelled. If the cavity size parameters required by the model are adjusted to reproduce solvation energies, quantitative agreement with experimental surface tensions is achieved. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most accurate theoretical estimation of this property so far. The results indicate that even if 'water structure' is important, its effects can be captured with a relatively simple model. They also contradict the inference from electrophoresis that there is strong hydroxide enhancement at the air-water interface. "

  abstract = {Oligomerization of human islet amyloid polypeptide (TAPP) has been
	increasingly considered a pathogenic process in type II diabetes.
	Here structural features of the IAPP monomer have been probed using
	a combination of ion mobility mass spectrometry (IMS-IMS) and all-atom
	replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations. Three distinct
	conformational families of human IAPP monomer are observed in IMS
	experiments, and two of them are identified as dehydrated solution
	structures on the basis of our simulation results: one is an extended
	beta-hairpin structural family, and the second is a compact helix-coil
	structural family. The extended beta-hairpin family is topologically
	similar to the peptide conformation in the solid-state NMR fibril
	structure published by Tycko and co-workers. It is absent in both
	experiments and simulations performed on the non-amyloidogenic rat
	IAPP, suggesting it may play an important role in the fibrillation
	pathway of human TAPP. In addition, pH dependence studies show that
	the relative abundance of the beta-hairpin structural family is significantly
	enhanced at pH 8.0. This observation is consistent with the increased
	rate of fibrillation at high pH in vitro and offers a possible explanation
	of the pH dependent fibrillation in vivo. This paper, to the best
	of our knowledge, presents the first experimental evidence of a significant
	population of beta-hairpin conformers for the IAPP peptide. It is
	consistent with a previous suggestion in the literature that beta-sheet-rich
	oligomers are assembled from ordered beta-hairpins rather than from
	coiled structures.},

	charge densities is presented. In contrast to the original induced
	point dipole model, the Gaussian polarization model is capable of
	finite interactions at short distances. Aspects of convergence related
	to the Gaussian model will be explored. The Gaussian polarization
	model is compared with the damped Thole-induced dipole model and
	the point dipole model. It will be shown that the Gaussian polarization
	model performs slightly better than the Thole model in terms of fitting
	to molecular polarizability tensors. An advantage of the model based
	on Gaussian charge distribution is that it can be easily generalized

This structure is intimately linked to the dynamics of water molecules, which can be measured using Raman and infrared spectroscopies. The assignment of spectral peaks depends on whether they are collective modes or single-molecule motions. Vibrational modes in liquids are usually considered to be associated to the motions of single molecules or small clusters. Using molecular dynamics simulations, here we find dispersive optical phonon-like modes in the librational and OH-stretching bands. We argue that on subpicosecond time scales these modes propagate through water/'s hydrogen-bond network over distances of up to 2[thinsp]nm. In the long wavelength limit these optical modes exhibit longitudinal-transverse splitting, indicating the presence of coherent long-range dipole-dipole interactions, as in ice. Our results indicate the dynamics of liquid water have more similarities to ice than previously thought.}

A new standard (p$^o$ = 0.1 MPa) molar enthalpy of formation at the temperature T = 298.15 K of the liquid 1,3-propanediol was measured using combustion calorimetry. A new molar enthalpy of vaporisation of 1,3-propanediol was derived from the vapour pressure temperature dependence measured by the transpiration method. Thermodynamic data on 1,3-propanediol available in the literature were collected, evaluated, and combined with own experimental results. This collection together with the new experimental results reported here has helped to resolve contradictions in the available enthalpies of formation data and to recommend the set of vaporisation and formation enthalpies for 1,3-propanediol at T = 298.15 K (in kJ . mol-1): Delta f H m $^o$ (g) = -(410.6 +/- 2.2), Delta f H m $^o$ (l) = -(481.8 +/- 2.2), and Delta l g H m $^o$ = (71.2 +/- 0.2) as the reliable benchmark properties for further thermochemical calculations. Quantum-chemical calculations of the gas phase molar enthalpy of formation of 1,3-propanediol have been performed using the \{G3MP2\} method and results were in excellent agreement with the recommended experimental values. The standard molar entropy of formation and the standard molar Gibbs function of formation have been calculated. "

   abstract = {We examine the performance of several molecular simulation techniques aimed at evaluation of the surface tension through its thermodynamic definition. For all methods explored, the surface tension is calculated by approximating the change in Helmholtz free energy associated with a change in interfacial area through simulation of a liquid slab at constant particle number, volume, and temperature. The methods explored fall within three general classes: free-energyperturbation, the Bennett acceptance-ratio scheme, and the expanded ensemble technique. Calculations are performed for both the truncated Lennard-Jones and square-well fluids at select temperatures spaced along their respective liquid-vapor saturation lines. Overall, we find that Bennett and expanded ensemble approaches provide the best combination of accuracy and precision. All of the methods, when applied using sufficiently small area perturbation, generate equivalent results for the Lennard-Jones fluid. However, single-stage free-energy-perturbation methods and the closely related test-area technique recently introduced by Gloor et al. [J. Chem. Phys.123, 134703 (2005)] generate surface tension values for the square-well fluid that are not consistent with those obtained from the more robust expanded ensemble and Bennett approaches, regardless of the size of the area perturbation. Single-stage perturbation methods fail also for the Lennard-Jones system when applied using large area perturbations. Here an analysis of phase-space overlap produces a quantitative explanation of the observed inaccuracy and shows that the satisfactory results obtained in these cases from the test-area method arise from a cancellation of errors that cannot be expected in general. We also briefly analyze the variation in method performance with respect to the adjustable parameters inherent to the techniques.}

	Nucleic Acids Force Fields}},
  journal = BTjctc,
  year = {2009},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {2514--2530},
  abstract = {We have carried out a set of explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD)
	simulations on two DNA quadruplex (G-DNA) molecules, namely the antiparallel
	d(G(4)T(4)G(4))(2) dimeric quadruplex with diagonal loops and the
	parallel-stranded human telomeric monomolecular quadruplex d{[}AGGG(TTAGGG)(3)]
	with three propeller loops. The main purpose of the paper was testing
	of the capability of the MD simulation technique to describe single-stranded
	topologies of G-DNA loops, which represent a very challenging task
	for computational methods. The total amount of conventional and locally
	enhanced sampling (LES) simulations analyzed in this study exceeds
	1.5 mu s, while we tested several versions of the AMBER force field
	(parm99, parmbsc0, and a version with modified glycosidic chi torsion
	profile) and the CHARMM27 force field. Further, we compared minimal
	salt and excess salt simulations. Postprocessing MM-PBSA (Molecular
	Mechanics, Poisson-Boltzmann, Surface Area) free energy calculations
	are also reported. None of the presently available force fields is
	accurate enough in describing the G-DNA loops. The imbalance is best
	seen for the propeller loops, as their experimental structure is
	lost within a few ns of standard simulations with all force fields.
	Among them, parmbsc0 provides results that are clearly closest to
	the experimental target values but still not in full agreement. This
	confirms that the improvement of the gamma torsional profile penalizing
	the gamma trans substates in the parmbsc0 parametrization was a step
	in the right direction, albeit not sufficient to treat all imbalances.
	The modified chi parametrization appears to rigidify the studied
	systems but does not change the ultimate outcome of the present simulations.
	The structures obtained in simulations with the modified chi profile
	are predetermined by its combination with either parm99 or parmbsc0.
	Experimental geometries of diagonal loops of d(G(4)T(4)G(4))(2) are
	stable in standard simulations on the similar to 10 ns time scale
	but are becoming progressively lost in longer and LES simulations.
	In addition, the d(G(4)T(4)G(4))(2) quadruplex contains, besides
	the three genuine binding sites for cations in the channel of its
	stem, also an ion binding site at each stem-loop junction. This arrangement
	of five cations in the quadruplex core region is entirely unstable
	in all 24 simulations that we attempted. Overall, our results confirm
	that G-DNA loops represent one of the most difficult targets for
	molecular modeling approaches and should be considered as reference
	structures in any future studies aiming to develop or tune nucleic
	acids force fields.},

	by Paul Joos for describing surface layers. The results of the proposed

	of adsorption for a diffusion-controlled mechanism depends on molecular
	reorientation or aggregation processes within the surface layer.
	For protein surface layers mainly conformational changes at the surface
	determine the rate of adsorption/desorption and other dynamic and
	mechanical properties of surface layers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

abstract = { The effects of crowding in biological environments on biomolecular structure, dynamics, and function remain not well understood. Computer simulations of atomistic models of concentrated peptide and protein systems at different levels of complexity are beginning to provide new insights. Crowding, weak interactions with other macromolecules and metabolites, and altered solvent properties within cellular environments appear to remodel the energy landscape of peptides and proteins in significant ways including the possibility of native state destabilization. Crowding is also seen to affect dynamic properties, both conformational dynamics and diffusional properties of macromolecules. Recent simulations that address these questions are reviewed here and discussed in the context of relevant experiments. }

	family of basis sets, with the largest being the aug-cc-pVQZ set.
	Polarized valence double zeta quality basis sets were found to yield
	corrections that differed substantially from larger basis set results.
	At the double zeta level, higher order corrections increased the
	binding energies, whereas calculations with triple and quadruple
	zeta basis sets gave the opposite effect. Although the absolute magnitude
	of the higher-order corrections was small for these diatomics, they
	were nonetheless significant in light of a target accuracy of +/-

	It is commonly believed that statistical potentials based on reduced
	atomic models are better able to discriminate native-like from misfolded
	decoys than scoring functions based on more detailed molecular mechanics
	models. Recent benchmark tests on small data sets, however, suggest
	otherwise. In this work, we report the results of extensive decoy
	detection tests using an effective free energy function based on
	the OPLS all-atom (OPLS-AA) force field and the Surface Generalized
	Born (SGB) model for the solvent electrostatic effects. The OPLS-AA/SGB
	effective free energy is used as a scoring function to detect native
	protein folds among a total of 48,832 decoys for 32 different proteins
	from Park and Levitt's 4-state-reduced, Levitt's local-minima, Baker's
	ROSETTA all-atom, and Skolnick's decoy sets. Solvent electrostatic
	effects are included through the Surface Generalized Born (SGB) model.
	All structures are locally minimized without restraints. From an
	analysis of the individual energy components of the OPLS-AA/SGB energy
	function for the native and the best-ranked decoy, it is determined
	that a balance of the terms of the potential is responsible for the
	minimized energies that most successfully distinguish the native
	from the misfolded conformations. Different combinations of individual
	energy terms provide less discrimination than the total energy. The
	results are consistent with observations that all-atom molecular
	potentials coupled with intermediate level solvent dielectric models
	are competitive with knowledge-based potentials for decoy detection
	and protein modeling problems such as fold recognition and homology
	modeling. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss.},

abstract = { Molecular simulations often use explicit-solvent models. Sometimes explicit-solvent models can give inaccurate values for basic liquid properties, such as the density, heat capacity, and permittivity, as well as inaccurate values for molecular transfer free energies. Such errors have motivated the development of more complex solvents, such as polarizable models. We describe an alternative here. We give new fixed-charge models of solvents for molecular simulations—water, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, and dichloromethane. Normally, such solvent models are parametrized to agree with experimental values of the neat liquid density and enthalpy of vaporization. Here, in addition to those properties, our parameters are chosen to give the correct dielectric constant. We find that these new parametrizations also happen to give better values for other properties, such as the self-diffusion coefficient. We believe that parametrizing fixed-charge solvent models to fit experimental dielectric constants may provide better and more efficient ways to treat solvents in computer simulations. },

	increased 27 degrees C and 4.5 degrees C, respectively. To explore
	the structural features responsible for this taxon specificity we
	crystallized natural crayfish trypsin in complex with chemically
	synthesized SGTI. This is the first X-ray structure of an arthropod
	trypsin and also the highest resolution (1.2 angstrom) structure
	of a trypsin-protein inhibitor complex reported so far. Structural
	data show that in addition to the primary binding loop, residues
	P-3-P-3 ` of SGTI, the interactions between SGTI and the crayfish
	enzyme are also extended over the P-12-P-4 and P-4 `-P-5 ` regions.
	This is partly due to a structural change of region P-10-P-4 in the
	SGTI structure induced by binding of the inhibitor to crayfish trypsin.
	The comparison of SGTI-crayfish trypsin and SGTI-bovine trypsin complexes
	by structure-based calculations revealed a significant interaction
	energy surplus for the SGTI-crayfish trypsin complex distributed
	over the entire binding region. The new regions that account for
	stronger and more specific binding of SGTI to crayfish than to bovine

The same procedure is used in this work to re-parameterize the simple point charge (SPC) model keeping the original geometry. The new model fails to reproduce the experimental self-diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity but improves the results at different temperatures and pressures of dielectric constant, isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion coefficient, surface tension, coexisting densities at the liquid-vapor interface, equation of state of ice Ih and equation of state of liquids at high pressures. A second model that reproduces the dielectric constant, self-diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity is proposed but the temperature of maximum density is 250 K, compared with the experimental value of 277 K. Both models improve the SPC/E results for almost all properties. The TIP3P model was also analyzed but the liquid density at 240 K always increases and a minimum in the dipole moment was not found. It is not possible to adjust for that model the charge distribution and short range interaction parameters to reproduce at the same time the target properties."

abstract = {Many atomistic potential models have been proposed to reproduce the properties of real water and to capture as many of its anomalies as possible. The large number of different models indicates that this task is by no means an easy one. Some models are reasonably successful for various properties, while others are designed to account for only a very few specific features of water accurately. Among the most popular models are SPC/E, TIP4P, TIP4P/2005, TIP4P/Ice, and TIP5P-E. Here, we report the equilibrium properties of the liquid-vapor coexistence, such as the densities of the liquid phase and the vapor phase, the interfacial tension between them, and the vapor pressure at saturation. From these data, the critical parameters are determined and subsequently used to cast the liquid-vapor coexistence properties into a corresponding-states form following Guggenheim’s suggestions. Doing so reveals that the three TIP4P-based models display the same corresponding-states behavior and that the SPC/E model behaves quite similarly. Only the TIP5P-E model shows clear deviations from the corresponding-states properties of the other models. A comparison with data for real water shows that the reduced surface tension is well described, while the reduced coexistence curve is too wide. The models underestimate the critical compressibility factor and overestimate Guggenheim’s ratio as well as the reduced boiling temperature (Guldberg’s ratio). As demonstrated by the collapse of the data for the TIP4P-based models, these deviations are inherent to the specific model and cannot be corrected by a simple reparametrization. For comparison, the results for two recent polarizable models, HBP and BK3, are shown, and both models are seen to perform well in terms of absolute numbers and in a corresponding-states framework. The kind of analysis applied here can therefore be used as a guideline in the design of more accurate and yet simple multi-purpose models of water.}

	the ordinary REM. We first point out that the ordinary REM has a
	shortage for the application to large systems such as biomolecules
	and that the Hamiltonian REM, an alternative formulation of the REM,
	can give a remedy for it. We then propose two examples of the Hamiltonian
	REM that are suitable for a coarse-grained protein model. (1) The
	scaled hydrophobicity REM prepares replicas that are characterized
	by various strengths of hydrophobic interaction. The strongest interaction
	that mimics aqueous solution environment makes proteins folding,
	while weakened hydrophobicity unfolds proteins as in organic solvent.
	Exchange between these environments enables proteins to escape from
	misfolded traps and accelerate conformational search. This resembles
	the roles of molecular chaperone that assist proteins to fold in
	vivo. (2) The phantom chain REM uses replicas that allow various
	degrees of atomic overlaps. By allowing atomic overlap in some of
	replicas, the peptide chain can cross over itself, which can accelerate
	conformation sampling. Using a coarse-gained model we developed,
	we compute equilibrium probability distributions for poly-alanine

The determination is based on the direct relationships which are established, by a physical interpretation of the observed approximate additivity of the interionic distance, between the crystal radii and the parameters entering plausible expressions for the first and second neighbor contributions to the Born repulsive energy. Two different forms of the repulsive energy are considered : the Huggins-Mayer form, having an exponential dependence on the ionic distance with a hardness parameter common to the family of salts, and the Pauling form, having an inverse-power dependence on the ionic distance, again with a common hardness parameter. The parameters for these forms are determined from solid-state data by a Huggins-type procedure. The crystal radii of the alkali and halogen ions in the NaCl structure obtained with the Huggins-Mayer form are, respectively, larger and smaller than the traditional crystal radii by about two-tenths of an angstrom. Their uncertainty is estimated to be about 0.05 {\AA} by comparison with the crystal radii obtained with the Pauling form. The crystal radii of the ions in NaCl and LiF agree rather closely with those deduced from the X-ray maps of the electron distribution available for these crystals. The value of the determination of electron maps for other alkali halide crystals is emphasized, to test in particular the significance of the small regular variations of the crystal radius of an ion from crystal to crystal suggested by the calculations. The applicability of the Born model procedure for the determination of crystal radii to other families of ionic solids is pointed out."

abstract = {First principles molecular dynamics simulation protocol is established using revised functional of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (revPBE) in conjunction with Grimme’s third generation of dispersion (D3) correction to describe the properties of water at ambient conditions. This study also demonstrates the consistency of the structure of water across both isobaric (NpT) and isothermal (NVT) ensembles. Going beyond the standard structural benchmarks for liquid water, we compute properties that are connected to both local structure and mass density fluctuations that are related to concepts of solvation and hydrophobicity. We directly compare our revPBE results to the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) plus Grimme dispersion corrections (D2) and both the empirical fixed charged model (SPC/E) and many body interaction potential model (MB-pol) to further our understanding of how the computed properties herein depend on the form of the interaction potential.}

abstract = {We introduce weighted atom-centered symmetry functions (wACSFs) as descriptors of a chemical system’s geometry for use in the prediction of chemical properties such as enthalpies or potential energies via machine learning. The wACSFs are based on conventional atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs) but overcome the undesirable scaling of the latter with an increasing number of different elements in a chemical system. The performance of these two descriptors is compared using them as inputs in high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNPs), employing the molecular structures and associated enthalpies of the 133 855 molecules containing up to five different elements reported in the QM9 database as reference data. A substantially smaller number of wACSFs than ACSFs is needed to obtain a comparable spatial resolution of the molecular structures. At the same time, this smaller set of wACSFs leads to a significantly better generalization performance in the machine learning potential than the large set of conventional ACSFs. Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic parameters of the descriptors can in principle be optimized with a genetic algorithm in a highly automated manner. For the wACSFs employed here, we find however that using a simple empirical parametrization scheme is sufficient in order to obtain HDNNPs with high accuracy.}

	the pure liquid or when a DME solute was solvated in the apolar solvent
	cyclohexane. For the solute hydrated in water, however, Delta G(pola)
	was found to be of the same order of magnitude as the discrepancy
	between the free energy of hydration from simulation using a nonpolarizable
	solute model and the experimental value. Thus, introducing polarizabilities
	clearly improves the transferability of the parameter set. Additionally,
	in calculations of an anion solvated in DME, Delta G(pola) for the
	solvent adopted relatively large values. From an estimation of the
	errors in the calculated free energy differences, it was furthermore
	shown that the calculation of Delta G(pola) offers an effective and
	accurate method to obtain differences in solvation (or excess) free
	energies between systems described by polarizable and nonpolarizable
	models when compared to a direct calculation of solvation (or excess)

To explain this{,} we suggest a simple protein model involving dihedrals with effective barriers forming a uniform distribution and show that for such a model{,} the entropy increases logarithmically with time until all significantly populated dihedral states have been sampled{,} in agreement with the simulations (during the simulations{,} 52-70%% of the available dihedral phase space has been visited). This is also confirmed by the analysis of the trajectories of a 1 ms simulation of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (31 kJ mol-1 difference in the entropy between the first and second part of the simulation). Strictly speaking{,} this means that it is practically impossible to equilibrate MD simulations of proteins. We discuss the implications of such a lack of strict equilibration of protein MD simulations and show that ligand-binding free energies estimated with the MM/GBSA method (molecular mechanics with generalised Born and surface-area solvation) vary by 3-15 kJ mol-1 during a 500 ns simulation (the higher estimate is caused by rare conformational changes){,} although they involve a questionable but well-converged normal-mode entropy estimate{,} whereas free energies estimated by free-energy perturbation vary by less than 0.6 kJ mol-1 for the same simulation."}

The particle arrangements have closely followed the experimental total scattering X-ray structure factors at each concentration. Applying four different geometric definitions for the hydrogen bond, cluster formation has also been studied. The majority of both ethanol and water molecules (i.e., their ‘hydroxylic’ hydrogen atoms) have an ideal (i.e., two) connectivity. A small ratio of molecules with higher than ideal connectivities was detected for the less strict hydrogen bond conditions. This is an indication that the strictest hydrogen bond condition, setting OO and OH distance ranges and an OHO angle of >150° as criteria, may need to be used for completely excluding irregular hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, for obtaining an at least semi-quantitative picture of the hydrogen bonded network, sensibly chosen distance based criteria are sufficient. The majority of ethanol oxygen atoms have been found to have lower than ideal connectivities for all concentrations and HB conditions, whereas for water molecules the majority of oxygen atoms have ideal connectivities. This finding is interpreted in terms of steric hindrance, caused by the (hydrophobic) ethyl group of ethanol molecules."

Percolation analyses revealed that each mixture (even the one containing 80mol%% ethanol) is above the 3D percolation threshold, with fractal dimensions, df, between 2.6 and 2.9, depending on concentration. Monotype water cluster formation was also studied in the mixtures: 3D water percolation can be found in systems with less than 40mol% ethanol, with fractal dimensions between 2.53 and 2.84. These observations can be put in parallel with experimental data on some thermodynamic quantities, such as the excess partial molar enthalpy and entropy."

The model is derived by considering the classical kinetic theory and requires, for its parametrization, only information on thermal conductivity of pure compounds. In this sense, the model is predictive. For most molten salt mixtures, no experimental data on thermal conductivity are available in the literature. This is a hindrance for many industrial applications (in particular for thermal energy storage technologies) as well as an obvious barrier for the validation of the theoretical model. To alleviate this lack of data, a series of equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations has been performed on several molten chloride systems in order to determine their thermal conductivity in the entire range of composition at two different temperatures: 1200 K and 1300 K. The EMD simulations are first principles type, as the potentials used to describe the interactions have been parametrized on the basis of first principle electronic structure calculations. In addition to the molten chlorides system, the model predictions are also compared to a recent similar EMD study on molten fluorides and with the few reliable experimental data available in the literature. The accuracy of the proposed model is within the reported numerical and/or experimental errors."

Nevertheless, many widely used approximations for the exchange-correlation (XC) functional describe the properties of pure water systems with an accuracy that is not fully satisfactory. The explicit inclusion of dispersion interactions generally improves the description, but there remain large disagreements between the predictions of different dispersion-inclusive methods. We present here a review of DFT work on water clusters, ice structures, and liquidwater, with the aim of elucidating how the strengths and weaknesses of different XC approximations manifest themselves across this variety of water systems. Our review highlights the crucial role of dispersion in describing the delicate balance between compact and extended structures of many different water systems, including the liquid. By referring to a wide range of published work, we argue that the correct description of exchange-overlap interactions is also extremely important, so that the choice of semi-local or hybrid functional employed in dispersion-inclusive methods is crucial. The origins and consequences of beyond-2-body errors of approximate XC functionals are noted, and we also discuss the substantial differences between different representations of dispersion. We propose a simple numerical scoring system that rates the performance of different XC functionals in describing water systems, and we suggest possible future developments."

	energies corresponding to the separated structural components. The
	problem is here treated for groups 1 and 11 monohalides and monohydrides,

	using the valence-state atoms-in-molecules (VSAM) model of von Szentpaly
	et al. (J. Phys. Chem. A 2001, 105, 9467). In this model, the Born-Haber-Fajans
	reference energy, U-POT, of free ions, M+ and Y-, is replaced by
	the energy of charged dissociation products, M delta+ and Y delta-,
	of equalized electronegativity. The partial atomic charge is obtained
	via the iso-electronegativity principle, and the asymptotic energy
	reference of separated free ions is lowered by the ``ion demotion

	delta(VS) is the valence-state partial charge and (I-VS,(M)-A(VS),(Y))

	the molecular valence-state dissociation energy, D (VS), of the VSAM
	model, and our valence-state-based lattice potential energy, U-VS
	= U-POT-1/2(1-\%(VS))(I-VS,(M)-A(VS),(Y)) = 1.230 D-VS + 86.4 kJ

  OPTabstract = {We present the GMTKN55 benchmark database for general main group thermochemistry, kinetics and noncovalent interactions. Compared to its popular predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2011, 7, 291], it allows assessment across a larger variety of chemical problems—with 13 new benchmark sets being presented for the first time—and it also provides reference values of significantly higher quality for most sets. GMTKN55 comprises 1505 relative energies based on 2462 single-point calculations and it is accessible to the user community via a dedicated website. Herein, we demonstrate the importance of better reference values, and we re-emphasise the need for London-dispersion corrections in density functional theory (DFT) treatments of thermochemical problems, including Minnesota methods. We assessed 217 variations of dispersion-corrected and -uncorrected density functional approximations, and carried out a detailed analysis of 83 of them to identify robust and reliable approaches. Double-hybrid functionals are the most reliable approaches for thermochemistry and noncovalent interactions, and they should be used whenever technically feasible. These are, in particular, DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ), DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ), and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The best hybrids are ωB97X-V, M052X-D3(0), and ωB97X-D3, but we also recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the best conventional global hybrid. At the meta-generalised-gradient (meta-GGA) level, the SCAN-D3(BJ) method can be recommended. Other meta-GGAs are outperformed by the GGA functionals revPBE-D3(BJ), B97-D3(BJ), and OLYP-D3(BJ). We note that many popular methods, such as B3LYP, are not part of our recommendations. In fact, with our results we hope to inspire a change in the user community's perception of common DFT methods. We also encourage method developers to use GMTKN55 for cross-validation studies of new methodologies.}

	by our CID data indicating that a monomer solution of the normal
	peptide contains similar to 46\% beta-sheet and similar to 23\% beta-turn
	content, in excellent agreement with our REMD simulations. Oligomerization
	was seen by IMS-MS for the normal peptide only, not the oxidized

	analysis shows that the normal and oxidized peptides have similar
	secondary and tertiary structural properties, suggesting that the
	inhibition of aggregation caused by methionine oxidation stems from
	mediating interpeptide interactions rather than by altering the peptide's
	monomeric conformation. In contrast, an increase in alpha-helical
	and random coil structural components relative to the normal peptide
	might be responsible for the lack of observed aggregation of the

Here, we describe the NuSol program in which three classes of algorithms were implemented to solve the 1D, 2D and 3D time independent nuclear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The Schr{\"o}dinger equation was solved using the finite differences based Numerov's method which was extended to higher dimensions, the more accurate pseudo-spectral Chebyshev collocation method and the s i n c discrete variable representation by Colbert and Miller. NuSol can be applied to solve the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for arbitrary analytical or numerical potentials with focus on nuclei bound by the potential of their molecular environment. We validated the methods against literature values for the 2D Henon-Heiles potential, the 3D linearly coupled sextic oscillators and applied them to study hydrogen bonding in the malonaldehyde derivate 4-cyano-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedione. With NuSol, the extent of nuclear delocalization in a given molecular potential can directly be calculated without relying on linear reaction coordinates in 3D molecular space.

abstract = { The electric quadrupole moments of a number of molecules have been determined from measurement of the birefringence induced in a gas by an electric field gradient. The values obtained are: carbon dioxide (− 14·27 ± 0·61)x 10−40 C m2, carbon monoxide (− 9·47 ± 0·15)x 10−40 C m2, nitrogen (− 4·65±0·08)x 10−40 C m2 and boron trifluoride (12·6±0·7)x 10−40 C m2. In the calculation of the moments for carbon monoxide and boron trifluoride the small hyperpolarizability contribution was neglected in the absence of known values. By means of the Jones calculus a detailed analysis was made of the effects of strain birefringence in the cell windows and imperfect orientation of polarizing components in the light path. This analysis led to a measurement procedure which yielded results significantly different from previously reported ones obtained with essentially the same apparatus. The probable error in the earlier procedure is identified. }

  abstract = {A correct representation of intermolecular interaction energies is
	necessary for reliable drug-receptor docking studies. While ab initio
	quantum chemistry with extended basis sets is the most accurate tool
	for that purpose, its use is precluded for very large molecular complexes.
	This constitutes the incentive for the development of accurate molecular
	mechanics potentials, in which the first-order electrostatic, and
	the second-order polarization energy contributions, are of essential
	importance. In this paper, we review the most important steps in
	the development of anisotropic, polarizable molecular mechanics (APMM)
	procedures. Among these, we illustrate validation tests of the ab
	initio-grounded, polarizable molecular mechanics potential, SIBFA
	(Sum of Interactions Between Fragments Ab initio computed). These
	are done by comparisons with parallel quantum-chemical (QC) results
	on representative multiply hydrogen-bonded complexes and polycoordinated
	complexes of one, or of two, divalent metal cations. For both kinds
	of complexes, the need to reproduce the non-additivity of the QC
	interaction energies is emphasized. One difficulty arises upon handling
	flexible molecules, due to the need to account simultaneously and
	consistently for the onset of inter- and intra-molecular polarization
	and charge-transfer effects. A new approach in the context of SIBFA
	was recently developed towards this aim, and tested in two cases
	of conformation-dependent cation-ligand interaction energies. The
	first relates to the complexes formed between the mecapto-carboxamide
	anion, an essential building-block of several Zn-metalloenzyme inhibitors,
	and Zn(II). The second relates to the complexes of the tetra-anionic
	pyrophosphate anion, a key building-block of ATP and GTP, with one
	or two divalent Zn(II) cations used as a probe. In the domain of
	applications, two recent studies are then presented. The first is
	the docking of the captopril drug to the active site of the binuclear
	Zn(II)- beta-lactamase enzyme. The second is the complex of a non-hydrolyzable
	analog of ATP with the active site of a binuclear Mg(II)-dependent
	kinase. An extension to an open-shell cation, Cu(II), is finally
	presented. The encouraging results presented in this review show
	that APMM procedures could be used in large-scale studies of ligand
	and drug-receptor interactions.}

	calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is
	tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous
	schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic
	potentials of the form C6R-6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected
	density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity
	(RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient
	computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended
	AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which
	reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend.
	By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients,
	the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced.
	The double counting of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes
	is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed.
	The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small
	molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene,
	and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene,

	and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost
	all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental
	results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained.
	For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP
	model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically
	overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical
	tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems
	in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate
	much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures
	can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of

	for elements up to xenon and a scaling factor for the dispersion
	part for several common density functionals (BLYP, PBE, TPSS, B3LYP)
	are reported. The new functional is tested in comparison with other
	GGAs and the B3LYP hybrid functional on standard thermochem. benchmark
	sets, for 40 noncovalently bound complexes, including large stacked
	aromatic mols. and group II element clusters, and for the computation
	of mol. geometries. Further cross-validation tests were performed
	for organometallic reactions and other difficult problems for standard

	the most accurate general purpose GGAs, reaching, for example for
	the G97/2 set of heat of formations, a mean absolute deviation of
	only 3.8 kcal mol-1. The performance for noncovalently bound systems
	including many pure van der Waals complexes is exceptionally good,
	reaching on the average CCSD(T) accuracy. The basic strategy in the
	development to restrict the density functional description to shorter
	electron correlation lengths scales and to describe situations with
	medium to large interat. distances by damped C6.cntdot.R-6 terms
	seems to be very successful, as demonstrated for some notoriously
	difficult reactions. As an example, for the isomerization of larger
	branched to linear alkanes, B97-D is the only DF available that yields
	the right sign for the energy difference. From a practical point
	of view, the new functional seems to be quite robust and it is thus
	suggested as an efficient and accurate quantum chem. method for large

The parametrization covers all spd-block elements and the lanthanides up to Z = 86 using reference data at the hybrid density functional theory level. Key features of the Hamiltonian are the use of partially polarized Gaussian-type orbitals, a double-ζ orbital basis for hydrogen, atomic-shell charges, diagonal third-order charge fluctuations, coordination number-dependent energy levels, a noncovalent halogen-bond potential, and the well-established D3 dispersion correction. The accuracy of the method, called Geometry, Frequency, Noncovalent, eXtended TB (GFN-xTB), is extensively benchmarked for various systems in comparison with existing semiempirical approaches, and the method is applied to a few representative structural problems in chemistry. }

abstract = {A black-box type procedure is presented for the generation of a molecule-specific, intermolecular potential energy function. The method uses quantum chemical (QC) information from our recently published extended tight-binding semi-empirical scheme (GFN-xTB) and can treat non-covalently bound complexes and aggregates with almost arbitrary chemical structure. The necessary QC information consists of the equilibrium structure, Mulliken atomic charges, charge centers of localized molecular orbitals, and also of frontier orbitals and orbital energies. The molecular pair potential includes model density dependent Pauli repulsion, penetration, as well as point charge electrostatics, the newly developed D4 dispersion energy model, Drude oscillators for polarization, and a charge-transfer term. Only one element-specific and about 20 global empirical parameters are needed to cover systems with nuclear charges up to radon (Z = 86). The method is tested for standard small molecule interaction energy benchmark sets where it provides accurate intermolecular energies and equilibrium distances. Examples for structures with a few hundred atoms including charged systems demonstrate the versatility of the approach. The method is implemented in a stand-alone computer code which enables rigid-body, global minimum energy searches for molecular aggregation or alignment.

	dynamics (MD) simulations, since these currently are limited to time
	scales shorter than a few nanoseconds. Given an initial conformation
	of the system, our method identifies one or more product states,
	which may be separated from the initial state by free energy barriers
	that are large on the scale of thermal energy. It also provides an
	approximate reaction path, which can be used to determine barrier
	heights or reaction rates with the usual techniques. The method employs
	an artificial potential that destabilizes the initial conformation
	and, thereby, lowers free energy barriers of structural transitions.
	As a result, transitions are accelerated and may be observed in MD
	simulations. An analytical estimate for the acceleration factor is
	given. The method is applied to two test systems, an argon microcluster
	and a simplified protein model. By these studies we demonstrated
	that our method is capable of shortening mean transition times from
	0.5 mu s (argon cluster) and 1.4 ns (protein model) to a few picoseconds.
	These results suggest that our method is particularly well suited

  abstract = {For the water molecule, the dipole is the first nonzero multipole
	moment; it represents the polarity of the molecule and has been widely
	used in describing solvation behavior. A rather wide range of theoretically
	determined values for the total molecular dipole moment of water
	in condensed phases has been reported in the literature. This paper
	describes a means by which the average total dipole moment for the
	water molecule in the liquid state can be linked to experimental
	refractive index data. Three components comprise the mean-field approach
	that is employed. A formal framework is developed that relates the
	temperature dependence of the effective molecular polarizability
	to the average local electric field experienced by a liquid water
	molecule over a chosen temperature range. A characterization of the
	distributions of local fields and field gradients is also necessary,
	and this has been determined from the computer simulations of liquid
	water samples at several different temperatures for two standard
	water potentials. The final component, the electric response properties
	of the water molecule (including nonlinear contributions up to fourth
	order), were determined from ab initio calculations for gas- and
	liquid-phase molecules, and are reported elsewhere [A. V. Gubskaya
	and P. G. Kusalik, Mol. Phys. 99, 1107 (2001)]. By combining these
	three components, the temperature dependence of the average local
	electric field, and consequently the average total dipole moment,
	are extracted from data for the refractive index of liquid water.
	An almost 10\% variation in the dipole moment with temperature is
	observed over the range 273 to 373 K. The value obtained for the
	molecular dipole moment at 300 K, 2.95+/-0.2 D, is in excellent agreement
	with a recently reported result extracted from x-ray scattering data,

Due to the limited size of our sample ($N_{ions}$=512), the calculated isotherms present van der Waals loops which can be described by an empirical equation of state whose critical parameters are $T_c$ =3068 K, $\rho_c$ =0.174 $g/cm^3$, and $P_c$ =105.4 bar. By comparing with the available experimental data on molten NaCl and according to corresponding states arguments, we are able to deduce from our simulation data an estimation of the critical parameters of real NaCl, namely, $T_c$ =3300 K, $\rho_c$ =0.18 $g/cm^3$, and $P_c$ =325 bar. The electrical conductivity of our simulated molten salt is then evaluated along the coexistence curve, in the highly compressed liquid and in the dilute gas. No evidence for an insulator-ionic conductor transition is found. Instead a continuous transition between a highly conducting fluid at high density and a low conducting gas at low temperature is pointed out. The degree of dissociation is obtained from the conductivity data and from the knowledge of the self-diffusion coefficients through a generalized Nernst-Einstein relation. The evolution of the degree of dissociation with density and temperature is corroborated by the analysis of the charge-charge distribution functions which show the occurrence of ion pairing at low density and low temperature. Finally, the mean field type behavior exhibited by our simulated molten salt is discussed in perspective with the available experimental data for other fused salts as well as with the current state of the theory concerning the criticality in ionic fluids."

	are introduced, the total energy of the water monomer decreases by
	about 4--5 mhartree, yielding a DMC energy of -76.428 30(5) hartree,
	which is only 10 mhartree above the experimental value. In our pseudopotential

	monomer and dimer obtained using the locality approximation with
	those from the variational scheme recently proposed by Casula [Phys.
	Rev. B 74, 161102(R) (2006)]. The time step errors in the Casula
	scheme are larger, and the extrapolation of the energy to zero time
	step always lies above the result obtained with the locality approximation.
	However, the errors cancel when energy differences are taken, yielding
	electronic dissociation energies within error bars of each other.
	The dissociation energies obtained in our various all-electron and
	pseudopotential calculations range between 5.03(7) and 5.47(9) kcal/mol
	and are in good agreement with experiment. Our calculations give

	and $\alpha$\^{}r of more than 650 molecules, where Image and Image
	are the mean values of the electronic polarizability tensor $\alpha$\^{}e
	and of the relaxation polarizability tensor $\alpha$\^{}r, respectively.
	It is assumed that $\alpha$\^{}e and $\alpha$\^{}r sum up to $\alpha$,
	the static polarizability of the molecule that can be directly measured
	through the dielectric constant. Thus, only values of $\alpha$\^{}e
	independent of the frequency are reported. The principal targets
	of this paper are: (1) to collect from literature the largest amount
	of experimental data of Image and Image and try to group the data
	for classification and characterization of the electrical behaviour
	of molecules; (2) to find out which classes of molecules have unusual
	Image and/or Image ; (3) to interpret the data in terms of charge
	distribution; and (4) to provide a basis for comparing with experiment
	the values Image and Image calculated by quantum chemical methods.
	The main conclusions are: Image increases with the number Z of electrons
	in the molecule so that the polarizability per electron (Image )
	is reasonably constant except for conjugated molecules (where it
	is slightly larger) and for halogenated molecules (where it is much
	smaller); Image ranges from very low to rather large values, apparently
	without any correlation nor with the corresponding Image or the number
	Z of electrons or the number v of oscillators in the molecule; the
	largest values of Image are reached for molecules having spherical
	shape and the largest ratio Image is attained by molecules containing
	several halogen atoms. These data seem to suggest an additive scheme
	for the mean value of the electronic polarizabllity. On the contrary,
	Image does not obey any additive scheme; large Image and large Image
	seem to be connected to large charge fluxes associated to vibrations
	and therefore to large electron-phonon coupling. All the above considerations
	hold for the mean values of the polarizability tensors. A different
	behaviour of the single components of $\alpha$\^{}e and $\alpha$\^{}r
	is also discussed.},

	potential energy scans. Fitting options for dihedral parameters include
	non-uniform weighting of the target data, constraining multiple optimized
	parameters to the same value, constraining parameters to be no greater
	than a user-specified maximum value, including all or only a subset
	of multiplicities defining the dihedral Fourier series, and optimization

	to map the affinity pattern of a protein for hydrophobic groups,

	assay that generates three-dimensional probability maps of fragment
	binding (FragMaps) indicating favorable fragment: protein interactions.
	Applied to the two-fold symmetric oncoprotein BCL-6, the SILCS method
	yields two-fold symmetric FragMaps that recapitulate the crystallographic

	both for important sequence and structure differences in the C-terminal

	Merck molecular force field (MMFF). It describes the objectives set
	for MMFF, the form it takes, and the range of systems to which it
	applies. This study also outlines the methodology employed in parameterizing
	MMFF94 and summarizes its performance in reproducing computational
	and experimental data. Though similar to MM3 in some respects, MMFF94
	differs in ways intended to facilitate application to condensed-phase
	processes in molecular-dynamics simulations. indeed, MMFF94 seeks
	to achieve MM3-like accuracy for small molecules in a combined `'organic/protein''
	force field that is equally applicable to proteins and other systems
	of biological significance. A second distinguishing feature is that
	the core portion of MMFF94 has primarily been derived from high-quality
	computational data-ca. 500 molecular structures optimized at the
	HF/6-31G{*} level, 475 structures optimized at the MP2/6-31G{*}
	level, 380 MP2/6-31G{*} structures evaluated at a defined approximation
	to the MP4SDQ/TZP level, and 1450 structures partly derived from
	MP2/6-31G{*} geometries and evaluated at the MP2/TZP level. A third
	distinguishing feature is that MMFF94 has been parameterized for
	a wide variety of chemical systems of interest to organic and medicial
	chemists, including many that feature frequently occurring combinations
	of functional groups for which little, if any, useful experimental
	data are available. The methodology used in parameterizing MMFF94
	represents a fourth distinguishing feature. Rather than using the
	common `'functional group'' approach, nearly all MMFF parameters
	have been determined in a mutually consistent fashion from the full
	set of available computational data. MMFF94 reproduces the computational
	data used in its parameterization very well. In addition, MMFF94
	reproduces experimental bond lengths (0.014 Angstrom root mean square
	{[}rms]), bond angles (1.2 degrees rms), vibrational frequencies
	(61 cm(-1) rms), conformational energies (0.38 kcal/mol rms), and
	rotational barriers (0.39 kcal/mol rms) very nearly as well as does
	MM3 for comparable systems. MMFF94 also describes intermolecular
	interactions in hydrogen-bonded systems in a way that closely parallels
	that given by the highly regarded OPLS force field. (C) 1996 by John

	A proper balance between solvent-solvent, solvent-solute, and solute-solute

  abstract = {This article describes the parameterization and performance of MMFF94

	lengths and angles, and it describes the derivation of quadratic
	force constants from HF/6-31G{*} data and the derivation of reference
	bond lengths and angles from fits to MP2/6-31G{*}-optimized geometries.
	Comparisons offered show that MMFF94 accurately reproduces the computational
	data used in its parameterization and demonstrate that its derivation
	from such data simultaneously confers the ability to reproduce experiment.
	In particular, MMFF94 reproduces experimentally determined bond lengths
	and angles for 30 organic molecules with root mean square (rms) deviations
	of 0.014 Angstrom and 1.2 degrees, respectively. MM3 reproduces bond
	angles to the same accuracy, but reproduces experimental bond lengths
	more accurately, in part because it was fit directly to thermally
	averaged experimental bond lengths; MMFF94, in contrast, was fit
	to (usually shorter) energy-minimum values, as is proper for an anharmonic
	force field intended for use in molecular-dynamics simulations. The
	comparisons also show that UFF and a recent version of CHARMm (QUANTA
	3.3 parameterization) are less accurate for molecular geometries
	than either MMFF94 or MM3. For vibrational frequencies, MMFF94 and
	MM3 give comparable overall rms deviations versus experiment of 61
	cm(-1) and 57 cm(-1), respectively, for 15 small, mostly organic
	molecules. In a number of instances, MM3's derivation employed observed
	frequencies that differ substantially by nearly 400 cm(-1) in one
	case-from other published frequencies which had themselves been confirmed
	theoretically by good-quality ab initio calculations. Overall, the
	comparisons to experimental geometries and vibrational frequencies
	demonstrate that MMFF94 achieves MM3-like accuracy for organic systems
	for which MM3 has been parameterized. Because MMFF94 is derived mainly
	from computational data, however, it has been possible to parameterize
	MMFF94 with equal rigor for a wide variety of additional systems
	for which little or no useful experimental data exist. Equally good
	performance can be expected for such systems. (C) 1996 by John Wiley

	to reproduce both computational and experimental data, the latter
	particularly in relation to MM3. The computational data included:
	(i) similar to 250 comparisons of conformational energy based on
	`'MP4SDQ/TZP'' calculations (triple-zeta plus polarization calculations
	at a defined approximation to the highly correlated MP4SDQ level)
	at MP2/6-31G{*} geometries; and (ii) similar to 1200 MP2/TZP comparisons
	of `'torsion profile'' structures at geometries derived from MP2/6-31G{*}
	geometries. The torsion parameters were derived in restrained least-squares
	fits that used the complete set of available computational data,
	thereby ensuring that a fully optimal set of parameters would be
	obtained. The final parameters reproduce the `'MP4SDQ/TZP'' and MP2/TZP
	computational data with root mean square (rms) deviations of 0.31
	and 0.50 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, MMFF94 reproduces a
	set of 37 experimental gas-phase and solution conformational energies,
	enthalpies, and free energies with a rms deviation of 0.38 kcal/mol;
	for comparison, the `'MP4SDQ/TZP'' calculations and MM3 each gives
	a rms deviation of 0.37 kcal/mol. Furthermore, MMFF94 reproduces
	28 experimentally determined rotational barriers with a rms deviation
	of 0.39 kcal/mol. Given the diverse nature of the experimental conformational
	energies and rotational barriers and the clear indications of experimental
	error in some cases, the MMFF94 results appear excellent. Nevertheless,
	MMFF94 encounters somewhat greater difficulty in handling multifunctional
	compounds that place highly polar functional groups in close proximity,
	probably because it, like other commonly used force fields, too greatly
	simplifies the description of electrostatic interactions. Some suggestions

	rich source of controversy and confusion. Our aim here is to critically
	examine central concepts in the description of protein hydration,
	and to assess the experimental basis for the current view of protein
	hydration, with the focus on dynamic aspects. Recent oxygen-17 magnetic
	relaxation dispersion (MRD) experiments have shown that the vast

	a mere twofold dynamic retardation compared with bulk water. The
	high mobility of hydration water ensures that all thermally activated
	processes at the protein-water interface, such as binding, recognition
	and catalysis, can proceed at high rates. The MRD-derived picture
	of a highly mobile hydration layer is consistent with recent molecular
	dynamics simulations, but is incompatible with results deduced from
	intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, dielectric
	relaxation and fluorescence spectroscopy. It is also inconsistent
	with the common view of hydration effects on protein hydrodynamics.

	for K\_W are in good agreement with experiment up to the critical

	a decreasing electrostatic stabilisation of the ions with increasing
	temperature and more subtle entropic effects. The possibility of

   abstract = "In a recent paper, the experimental 2D-Raman-THz response of liquid water at ambient conditions has been presented [J. Savolainen, S. Ahmed, and P. Hamm, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.110, 20402 (2013)]. Here, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations are performed with the goal to reproduce the experimental results. To that end, the molecular response functions are calculated in a first step, and are then convoluted with the laser pulses in order to enable a direct comparison with the experimental results. The molecular dynamics simulation are performed with several different water models: TIP4P/2005, SWM4-NDP, and TL4P. As polarizability is essential to describe the 2D-Raman-THz response, the TIP4P/2005 water molecules are amended with either an isotropic or a anisotropic polarizability a posteriori after the molecular dynamics simulation. In contrast, SWM4-NDP and TL4P are intrinsically polarizable, and hence the 2D-Raman-THz response can be calculated in a self-consistent way, using the same force field as during the molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the 2D-Raman-THz response depends extremely sensitively on details of the water model, and in particular on details of the description of polarizability. Despite the limited time resolution of the experiment, it could easily distinguish between various water models. Albeit not perfect, the overall best agreement with the experimental data is obtained for the TL4P water model."

	Details of the molecular polarizability are found to be important.
	For instance, all elements of the polarizability tensor, rather then

	the mean amide molecular dipole magnitude, which is 50\% larger in

	alignment of the molecular dipoles. Polarizable models of amide compounds

  OPTabstract = {Background: Accurately covering the conformational space of amino
	acid side chains is essential for important applications such as
	protein design, docking and high resolution structure prediction.
	Today, the most common way to capture this conformational space is
	through rotamer libraries - discrete collections of side chain conformations
	derived from experimentally determined protein structures. The discretization
	can be exploited to efficiently search the conformational space.
	However, discretizing this naturally continuous space comes at the
	cost of losing detailed information that is crucial for certain applications.
	For example, rigorously combining rotamers with physical force fields
	is associated with numerous problems. Results: In this work we present
	BASILISK: a generative, probabilistic model of the conformational
	space of side chains that makes it possible to sample in continuous
	space. In addition, sampling can be conditional upon the protein's
	detailed backbone conformation, again in continuous space - without
	involving discretization. Conclusions: A careful analysis of the
	model and a comparison with various rotamer libraries indicates that
	the model forms an excellent, fully continuous model of side chain
	conformational space. We also illustrate how the model can be used
	for rigorous, unbiased sampling with a physical force field, and
	how it improves side chain prediction when used as a pseudo-energy
	term. In conclusion, BASILISK is an important step forward on the
	way to a rigorous probabilistic description of protein structure

Enhancements with respect to the previous version (OPLS2.1) include the addition of off-atom charge sites to represent halogen bonding and aryl nitrogen lone pairs as well as a complete refit of peptide dihedral parameters to better model the native structure of proteins. To adequately cover medicinal chemical space, OPLS3 employs over an order of magnitude more reference data and associated parameter types relative to other commonly used small molecule force fields (e.g., MMFF and OPLS\_2005). As a consequence, OPLS3 achieves a high level of accuracy across performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities and solvation. The newly fitted peptide dihedrals lead to significant improvements in the representation of secondary structure elements in simulated peptides and native structure stability over a number of proteins. Together, the improvements made to both the small molecule and protein force field lead to a high level of accuracy in predicting protein-ligand binding measured over a wide range of targets and ligands (less than 1 kcal/mol RMS error) representing a 30\% improvement over earlier variants of the OPLS force field. }

	used during extended shutdowns and cold restarts, is effective only
	up to 50\% water cut. Because more time and resources would be required
	to bring a new AA LDHI, more detailed analysis were performed to
	evaluate the possibility of managing hydrate risks through operating
	procedures. It was found that during extended shutdown, the wellbore
	fluid can be pushed down below the mudline using the dry gas from
	the glycol contact tower followed by diesel or methanol. Thus, it
	eliminates the hydrate risk during extended shutdowns. Confirmed
	by the actual data, the cold restart simulations found the warm-up
	time in the wellbore to be less than an hour. The actual data also
	show the cumulative water cut one hour after restart was found to
	be below 50\%. The cold restart procedures have been updated with
	the strategy to outrun the water and come out of the hydrate condition
	as quickly as possible. Since then, the well has been brought on
	production using the existing LDHI without any hydrate problems,
	even with a water cut approaching 90\%. 1930-1855}

abstract = { We have developed a polarizable water model for classical molecular dynamics simulations of vibrational spectroscopies, which covers from low-frequency intermolecular modes to high-frequency intramolecular vibrational modes. The model utilizes the ab initio derived geometry-dependent multipole moment surfaces to depict the instantaneous charge density of a water molecule. Multipoles up to quadrupole are included for the permanent multipoles, while those up to dipole are included for the induced multipoles. The polarization of molecules is described by a distributed polarizability model. At room temperature, the present model is able to reproduce experimental infrared and Raman spectra of intramolecular vibrational modes, except for the blue peak shift due to a limitation of the classical simulation based on a quantum mechanical potential. The calculated infrared spectrum for low-frequency intermolecular modes agreed reasonably well with the experimental signals. }

   ozone}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are warming the global climate at
   an unprecedented rate. Significant emission reductions will be required
   soon to avoid a rapid temperature rise. As a potential interim measure
   to avoid extreme temperature increase, it has been suggested that
   Earth's albedo be increased by artificially enhancing stratospheric
   sulfate aerosols. We use a 3D chemistry climate model, fed by aerosol
   size distributions from a zonal mean aerosol model, to simulate
   continuous injection of 1-10 Mt/a into the lower tropical stratosphere.
   In contrast to the case for all previous work, the particles are
   predicted to grow to larger sizes than are observed after volcanic
   eruptions. The reason is the continuous supply of sulfuric acid and
   hence freshly formed small aerosol particles, which enhance the
   formation of large aerosol particles by coagulation and, to a lesser
   extent, by condensation. Owing to their large size, these particles have
   a reduced albedo. Furthermore, their sedimentation results in a
   non-linear relationship between stratospheric aerosol burden and annual
   injection, leading to a reduction of the targeted cooling. More
   importantly, the sedimenting particles heat the tropical cold point
   tropopause and, hence, the stratospheric entry mixing ratio of H(2)O
   increases. Therefore, geoengineering by means of sulfate aerosols is
   predicted to accelerate the hydroxyl catalyzed ozone destruction cycles
   and cause a significant depletion of the ozone layer even though future
   halogen concentrations will be significantly reduced.}},

abstract = { The derivation of atomic polarizabilities for polarizable force field development has been a long-standing problem. Atomic polarizabilities were often refined manually starting from tabulated values, rendering an automated assignment of parameters difficult and hampering reproducibility and transferability of the obtained values. To overcome this, we trained both a linear increment scheme and a multilayer perceptron neural network on a large number of high-quality quantum mechanical atomic polarizabilities and partial atomic charges, where only the type of each atom and its connectivity were used as input. The predicted atomic polarizabilities and charges had average errors of 0.023 Å3 and 0.019 e using the neural net and 0.063 Å3 and 0.069 e using the simple increment scheme. As the algorithm relies only on the connectivities of the atoms within a molecule, thus omitting dependencies on the three-dimensional conformation, the approach naturally assigns like charges and polarizabilities to symmetrical groups. Accordingly, a convenient utility is presented for generating the partial atomic charges and atomic polarizabilities for organic molecules as needed in polarizable force field development. }

  abstract = {Glancing angle laser-induced fluorescence was used to investigate
	the effects of organic monolayer coatings on the ozonation kinetics
	of pyrene at the air-aqueous interface. Fluorescence spectra show
	that both 1-octanol and octanoic acid coatings give rise to similar
	decreased polarity at the interface relative to the uncoated surface
	and show a similar propensity of pyrene to partition to the interface.
	Ozonation kinetics follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, indicating
	a surface reaction. At high ozone concentrations, a monolayer coating
	of 1-octanol enhances the rate relative to the uncoated surface and
	a coating of octanoic acid decreases the rate. Pyrene fluorescence
	is most efficiently quenched by ozone in the presence Of a 1-octanol
	coating, followed by the uncoated surface, and least efficiently
	quenched by ozone in the presence of octanoic acid. In agreement
	with earlier work, a significant photoenhancement of the ozonation
	is observed at the uncoated surface; however, no enhancement is observed
	with monolayer coatings of either organic. Quantum chemical calculations
	indicate a reasonable binding of ozone by the carboxylic acid group
	(in both its dissociated and undissociated forms). We suggest that
	the inhibition of the water surface reaction by a monolayer of octanoic
	acid is due to the sequestration of ozone by the carboxylic acid
	group.},

  abstract = {A method has been developed to detect dense clusters of residue side-chains
	in proteins, where contact is based upon the percentage of the maximum
	possible for a given residue type. The clusters represent protein
	sites with the highest degree of interaction amongst their member
	residues, while contacts with the environment surrounding the cluster
	are lower in number. The method has been applied to three distinct
	structural sets of proteins to check for consistency: mixed alpha-helical/beta-sheet
	proteins, all beta-strand proteins, and all alpha-helical proteins.
	A number of cluster features generated from these sets are of general
	interest for protein folding. (1) A majority of the clusters, comprising
	three to four residues on average, are localized near the protein
	surfaces and not within the protein cores. (2) The clusters have
	preferences for the N- and C-terminal ends of alpha-helices and beta-strands
	in alpha/beta and alpha-proteins, while beta-proteins utilize the
	middle strand regions more often. A number of clusters connect three
	or more beta-strands and/or alpha-helices. (3) More than half of
	the clusters display residue pairs with oppositely charged atoms
	within 4.5 A of each other. (4) The residue composition of the clusters
	does not show correlation with hydrophobicity measures but rather
	with side-chain volume and surface. The highly preferred cluster
	residues are (in order of decreasing preference) Trp, His, Arg, Tyr,
	Glu, Gln and Phe. Clusters with extensive internal contacts in related
	haemoglobin and immunoglobulin tertiary structures show respective
	conservation. Several examples illustrate ``strategic'' folding positions
	in proteins that often bring together a number of sheets and/or helices,
	suggesting a folding model in which largely preformed secondary structures
	are joined together in a cluster induced collapse. Alternatively,
	the clusters may form at some stage in the folding process to reduce
	considerably the searchable conformational space and help maintain
	the proper folding pathway. The clusters also provide hints for site-directed
	mutagenesis and protein engineering experiments as they are also
	suggested to be important for structural stability.},

  abstract = {Molecular simulation is an extremely useful, but computationally very
	expensive tool for studies of chemical and biomolecular systems.
	Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation
	toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance
	on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded
	routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines.
	The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition
	algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel
	constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow
	removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration
	time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel.
	To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald
	electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program,
	Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for
	direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination
	of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems
	but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest
	numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

  pages = {8830--8835},
  abstract = {Knowledge of thermal expansivity can aid in the understanding of both
	microscopic and macroscopic behavior of clathrate hydrates. Diffraction
	studies have shown that hydrate volume changes significantly (as
	much as 1.5\% over 50 K) as a function of temperature. It has been
	demonstrated previously via statistical mechanics that a minor change
	in hydrate volume (e.g., a 1.5\% change in volume or 0.5\% change
	in lattice parameter) can lead to a major change in the predicted
	hydrate formation pressure (e.g., > 15\% at > 100 MPa for methane).
	Because of this sensitivity, hydrate thermal expansivity measurements,
	for both Structures I and II with various guests, are needed help
	quantify volume distortions in hydrate lattices to ensure accurate
	hydrate phase equilibria predictions. In addition to macroscopic
	phase equilibria, the thermal expansion of different hydrates can
	give information about the interactions between the guest molecules
	and the host lattice. In this work, the hydrate lattice parameters
	for four Structure I (C2H6, CO2, 47\% C2H6 + 53\% CO2, and 85\% CH4
	+ 15\% CO2) and seven Structure II (C3H8, 60\% CH4 + 40\% C3H8, 30\%

	95\% CH4 + 5\% C5H10O, and a natural gas mixture) systems were measured
	as a function of temperature. The lattice parameter measurements
	were combined with existing literature values. Both sI and sII hydrates,
	with a few exceptions, had a common thermal expansivity, independent
	of hydrate guest. Many guest-dependent correlations for linear thermal
	expansivity have been proposed. However, we present two guest-independent,
	structure-dependent correlations for sI and sII lattices, which have
	been developed to express the normalized hydrate lattice parameters
	(and therefore volume) as a function of temperature. 1520-6106}

  abstract = {The hydration structure of human lysozyme was studied with cryogenic
	X-ray diffraction experiment and molecular dynamics simulations.
	The crystal structure analysis at a resolution of 1.4 Angstrom provided
	405 crystal water molecules around the enzyme. In the simulations
	at 300 K, the crystal structure was immersed in explicit water molecules.
	We examined correlations between crystal water sites and two physical
	quantities calculated from the 1-ns simulation trajectories: the
	solvent density reflecting the time-averaged distribution of water
	molecules, and the solvent dipole measuring the orientational ordering
	of water molecules around the enzyme. The local high solvent density
	sites were consistent with the crystal water sites, and better correlation
	was observed around surface residues with smaller conformational
	fluctuations during the simulations. Solvent dipoles around those
	sites exhibited coherent and persistent ordering, indicating that
	the hydration water molecules at the crystal water sites were highly
	oriented through the interactions with hydrophilic residues. Those
	water molecules restrained the orientational motions of adjoining
	water molecules and induced a solvent dipole field, which was persistent
	during the simulations around the enzyme. The coherent ordering was
	particularly prominent in and around the active site cleft of the
	enzyme. Because the ordering was significant up to the third to fourth
	solvent layer region from the enzyme surface, the coherently ordered
	solvent dipoles likely contributed to the molecular recognition of
	the enzyme in a long-distance range. The present work may provide
	a new approach combining computational and the experimental studies
	to understand protein hydration. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Peptides often have conformational preferences. We simulated 133 peptide
	8-mer fragments from six different proteins, sampled by replica-exchange
	molecular dynamics using Amber7 with a GB/SA (generalized-Born/solvent-accessible
	electrostatic approximation to water) implicit solvent. We found
	that 85 of the peptides have no preferred structure, while 48 of
	them converge to a preferred structure. In 85\% of the converged
	cases (41 peptides), the structures found by the simulations bear
	some resemblance to their native structures, based on a coarse-grained
	backbone description. In particular, all seven of the beta hairpins
	in the native structures contain a fragment in the turn that is highly
	structured. In the eight cases where the bioinformatics-based I-sites
	library picks out native-like structures, the present simulations
	are largely in agreement. Such physics-based modeling may be useful
	for identifying early nuclei in folding kinetics and for assisting
	in protein-structure prediction methods that utilize the assembly

  abstract = {Using first principles molecular dynamics simulation, we have studied
	a fluoride anion embedded in a periodically replicated water slab
	composed of 215 water molecules to mimic both bulk and interfacial
	solvation. In contrast to some recent experiments, our findings suggest
	that there are only small structural changes for fluoride and its
	first solvation shell in the bulk. Moreover, the presence of fluoride
	does not significantly alter the rotational dynamics of nearby water.
	In addition, we have computed the molecular dipole moments using
	Wannier centers. At the interface, the presence of fluoride increases
	the molecular dipole moments of nearby water molecules, whereas in
	the bulk, the dipole moments for water appear to be essentially invariant
	to the presence of fluoride in the vicinity. Previous studies of
	the air-water interface have showed interfacial water to have higher
	average HOMO energies and, thus, likely to be more prone to electrophilic
	attack. With the addition of fluoride, the most likely reactive site
	for electrophilic reactions shifts to the anion. This finding could
	explain the known large increase in reaction rates for heterogeneous
	process of interest in atmospheric science. The reactive properties
	of other anions near the air-water interface are of general interest
	in heterogeneous chemistry and can be elucidated using a similar
	type of analysis, as performed here for the fluoride anion.},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{186-190}},
Abstract = {{Halogens released from long-lived anthropogenic substances, such as
   chlorofluorocarbons, are the principal cause of recent depletion of
   stratospheric ozone, a greenhouse gas(1-3). Recent observations show
   that very short-lived substances, with lifetimes generally under six
   months, are also an important source of stratospheric halogens(4,5).
   Short-lived bromine substances are produced naturally by seaweed and
   phytoplankton, whereas short-lived chlorine substances are primarily
   anthropogenic. Here we used a chemical transport model to quantify the
   depletion of ozone in the lower stratosphere from short-lived halogen
   substances, and a radiative transfer model to quantify the radiative
   effects of that ozone depletion. According to our simulations, ozone
   loss from short-lived substances had a radiative effect nearly half that
   from long-lived halocarbons in 2011 and, since pre-industrial times, has
   contributed a total of about -0.02 W m(-2) to global radiative forcing.
   We find natural short-lived bromine substances exert a 3.6 times larger
   ozone radiative effect than long-lived halocarbons, normalized by
   halogen content, and show atmospheric levels of dichloromethane, a
   short-lived chlorine substance not controlled by the Montreal Protocol,
   are rapidly increasing. We conclude that potential further significant
   increases in the atmospheric abundance of short-lived halogen
   substances, through changing natural processes(6-8) or continued
   anthropogenic emissions(9), could be important for future climate.}},

abstract = { We report simulation results regarding the hydration process of the guanidinium cation in water droplets and in bulk liquid water, at a low concentration of 0.03 M, performed using a polarizable approach to model both water/water and ion/water interactions. In line with earlier theoretical studies, our simulations show a preferential orientation of guanidinium at water-vacuum interfaces, i.e., a parallel orientation of the guanidinium plane to the aqueous surface. In an apparent contradiction with earlier simulation studies, we show also that guanidinium has a stronger propensity for the cores of aqueous systems than the ammonium cation. However, our bulk simulation conditions correspond to weaker cation concentrations than in earlier studies, by 2 orders of magnitude, and that the same simulations performed using a standard nonpolarizable force field leads to the same conclusion. From droplet data, we extrapolate the guanidinium single hydration enthalpy value to be −82.9 ± 2.2 kcal mol-1. That is about half as large as the sole experimental estimate reported to date, about −144 kcal mol-1. Our result yields a guanidinium absolute bulk hydration free energy at ambiant conditions to be −78.4 ± 2.6 kcal mol-1, a value smaller by 3 kcal mol-1 compared to ammonium. The relatively large magnitude of our guanidinium hydration free energy estimate suggests the Gdm+ protein denaturing properties to result from a competition between the cation hydration effects and the cation/protein interactions, a competition that can be modulated by weak differences in the protein or in the cation chemical environment. }

	for CO(2) is that its equilibrium configuration is linear, which
	would have only two rotational modes, but during the dynamics it
	is never exactly linear, so that there is a third mode from rotational
	about the axis. In this work, we show how to treat such linear molecules

In this work, we explore the equivalency of these two models by comparing condensed phase properties  computed using the Drude force field and a multipole and induced dipole (MPID) model. Presented is an approach to map the electrostatic model  optimized in the context of the Drude force field onto the MPID model.  Condensed phase simulations on water and 15 small model compounds show that without any reparametrization, the MPID model yields properties similar to the Drude force field with both models yielding satisfactory reproduction of a range of experimental values and quantum mechanical data. Our results illustrate that the Drude oscillator model and the point induced dipole model  are different representations of essentially the same physical model. However, results indicate the presence of small differences between the use of atomic multipoles and off-center charge sites. Additionally, results on the use of dispersion particle mesh Ewald further support its utility for treating long-range Lennard Jones dispersion contributions in the context of polarizable force fields. The main motivation in demonstrating the transferability of parameters between the Drude and MPID models is that the more than 15 years of development of the Drude polarizable force field can now be used with MPID formalism without the need for dual-thermostat integrators nor self-consistent iterations. This opens up a wide range of new methodological opportunities for polarizable models."

  abstract = {As a member of the ubiquitous ammonium transporter/methylamine permease/Rhesus
	(Amt/MEP/Rh) family of membrane protein channels, the 50 kDa Rhesus
	channel (Rh50) has been implicated in ammonia (NH(3)) and, more recently,
	also in carbon dioxide (CO(2)) transport. Here we present molecular
	dynamics simulations of spontaneous full permeation events of ammonia
	and carbon dioxide across Rh50 from Nitrosomonas europaea. The simulations
	show that Rh50 is functional in its crystallographic conformation,
	without the requirement for a major conformational change or the
	action of a protein partner. To assess the physiological relevance
	of NH(3) and CO(2) permeation across Rh50, we have computed potentials
	of mean force (PMFs) and permeabilities for NH(3) and CO(2) flux
	across Rh50 and compare them to permeation through a wide range of
	lipid membranes, either composed of pure lipids or composed of lipids
	plus an increasing cholesterol content. According to the PMFs, Rh50
	is expected to enhance NH(3) flux across dense membranes, such as
	membranes with a substantial cholesterol content. Although cholesterol
	reduces the intrinsic CO(2) permeability of lipid membranes, the
	CO(2) permeabilities of all membranes studied here are too high to
	allow significant Rh50-mediated CO(2) flux. The increased barrier
	in the PMF for water permeation across Rh50 shows that Rh50 discriminates
	40-fold between water and NH(3). Thus, Rh50 channels complement aquaporins,
	allowing the cell to regulate water and NH(3) flux independently.
	The PMFs for methylamine and NH(3) are virtually identical, suggesting
	that methylamine provides an excellent model for NH(3) in functional
	experiments.},

	have performed potential of mean force calculations of a hydronium

	First, because the hydrogen bond acceptance capacity of hydronium
	is weaker than water and it is more favorable to have the hydronium
	oxygen on the surface. Second, hydroxide ions are expelled from the
	surface of the droplets, due to the entropy being lower when a hydroxide
	ion is hydrated on the surface. As a result, the water dissociation
	constant pK(w) increases slightly near the surface. The results are
	corroborated by calculations of surface tension of NaOH solutions

Abstract = {{The potential for generation of highly reactive chlorine and bromine
   atoms from sea salt particles in the troposphere has been recognized for
   many years. This chemistry is of particular interest because of the
   complex interactions of halogen atoms with ozone as well as with
   organics, which can lead to either the formation or destruction of
   tropospheric ozone, depending on the conditions. While a variety of
   reactions of tropospherically important gases with sea salt and its
   major components, NaCl and NaBr, have been identified, the chemical and
   physical interactions are not well understood on a molecular scale. As a
   result, quantification of the contribution of sea salt chemistry to the
   marine boundary layer, as well as in other circumstances where such
   chemistry may be important, is not yet possible. We discuss here
   research from the authors' laboratories which is directed to
   understanding the chemistry of sea salt, NaCl, and NaBr on a molecular
   level in sufficient detail to provide a firm basis for incorporating
   this heterogeneous chemistry into atmospheric models. Implications for
   chemistry in the marine boundary layer and in the Arctic at polar
   sunrise are discussed, and areas of particular uncertainty highlighted.}},

	for the calculation of induced dipoles, i.e. resolution of the self-consistent
	equations and a `Car-Parrinello' dynamical approach. In this latter,
	the induced dipoles are calculated at each time step of the dynamics
	through the dynamics of additional degrees of freedom associated
	with the dipoles. This method saves computer time and allows to study
	polarized solvated proteins at a very low CPU cost. The program is
	written in C-language and runs on LINUX machines. A detailed manual
	of the code is given. The main features of the package are illustrated
	taking on examples of proteins in the gas phase or immersed in liquid

  abstract = {Biomolecule conformational change has been widely investigated in
	solution using several methods; however, much less experimental data
	about structural changes are available for completely isolated, gas-phase
	biomolecules. Studies of conformational change in unsolvated biomolecules
	are required to complement the interpretation of mass spectrometry
	measurements and in addition, can provide a means to directly test
	theoretical simulations of biomolecule structure and dynamics independent
	of a simulated solvent. In this Feature Article, we review our recent
	introduction of a fluorescence-based method for probing local conformational
	dynamics in unsolvated biomolecules through interactions of an attached
	dye with tryptophan (Trp) residues and fields originating on charge
	sites. Dye-derivatized biomolecule ions are formed by electrospray
	ionization and are trapped in a variable-temperature quadrupole ion
	trap in which they are irradiated with either continuous or short
	pulse lasers to excite fluorescence. Fluorescence is measured as
	a function of temperature for different charge states. Optical measurements
	of the dye fluorescence include average intensity changes, changes
	in the emission spectrum, and time-resolved measurements of the fluorescence
	decay. These measurements have been applied to the miniprotein, Trp-cage,
	polyproline peptides and to a beta-hairpin-forming peptide, and the
	results are presented as examples of the broad applicability and
	utility of these methods. Model fits to Trp-cage fluorescence data
	measured as a function of temperature provide quantitative information
	on the thermodynamics of conformational changes, which are reproduced
	well by molecular dynamics. Timeresolved measurements of the fluorescence
	decays of Trp-cage and small polyproline peptides definitively demonstrate
	the occurrence of fluorescence quenching by the amino acid Trp in
	unsolvated biomolecules.},

   abstract = "Atom-centered point charge (PC) model of the molecular electrostatics-a major workhorse of the atomistic biomolecular simulations-is usually parameterized by least-squares (LS) fitting of the point charge values to a reference electrostatic potential, a procedure that suffers from numerical instabilities due to the ill-conditioned nature of the LS problem. To reveal the origins of this ill-conditioning, we start with a general treatment of the point charge fitting problem as an inverse problem and construct an analytical model with the point charges spherically arranged according to Lebedev quadrature which is naturally suited for the inverse electrostatic problem. This analytical model is contrasted to the atom-centered point-charge model that can be viewed as an irregular quadrature poorly suited for the problem. This analysis shows that the numerical problems of the point charge fitting are due to the decay of the curvatures corresponding to the eigenvectors of LS sum Hessian matrix. In part, this ill-conditioning is intrinsic to the problem and is related to decreasing electrostatic contribution of the higher multipole moments, that are, in the case of Lebedev grid model, directly associated with the Hessian eigenvectors. For the atom-centered model, this association breaks down beyond the first few eigenvectors related to the high-curvature monopole and dipole terms; this leads to even wider spread-out of the Hessian curvature values. Using these insights, it is possible to alleviate the ill-conditioning of the LS point-charge fitting without introducing external restraints and/or constraints. Also, as the analytical Lebedev grid PC model proposed here can reproduce multipole moments up to a given rank, it may provide a promising alternative to including explicit multipole terms in a force field."

OPC3 is significantly more accurate than the commonly used water models of same class (TIP3P and SPCE) in reproducing a comprehensive set of liquid bulk properties, over a wide range of temperatures. Beyond bulk properties, we show that OPC3 predicts the intrinsic charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) of water — a characteristic dependence of hydration free energy on the sign of the solute charge — in very close agreement with experiment. Two other recent 3-point rigid water models, TIP3PFB and H2ODC, each developed by its own, completely different optimization method, approach the global accuracy optimum represented by OPC3 in both the parameter space and accuracy of bulk properties. Thus, we argue that an accuracy limit of practical 3-point rigid non-polarizable models has effectively been reached; remaining accuracy issues are discussed.",

	models have been developed to predict molecular polarizability using
	two types of approaches. The first type of approaches is based on
	Slater's rules of calculating the effective atomic nuclear shielding
	constants. The best model (model 1A) of this category has achieved
	an average unsigned error (AUE), root-mean square error (RMSE), and
	average percent error (APE) of 2.23 au, 3.29 au, and 2.77\%\%, respectively.
	The second type of model is based on an additive hypothesis of molecular

	schemes of atom types. The best model that applies 14 atom types,
	model 2e, achieves AUE, RMSE, and APE of 0.99 au, 1.48 au, and 1.24\%,

	and 7-9, were found. Analysis of the H-1 and C-13 NMR chemical shifts

	equation of state (EoS), coupled with the classical thermodynamic
	equation for hydrates, has been used in the prediction of hydrate
	formation for over 40 years. In Part I of this series [Fluid Phase
	Equilib. 194 (2002) 371], we proposed an alternative derivation of
	these equations using a different standard state. The new hydrate
	equations were shown to be simpler to use. The new approach allows
	for a full description of each phase via fugacity models. This is
	the second article in a series of four, providing a description of
	an aqueous phase fugacity model tailored specifically for the presence
	of mixed hydrate inhibitors such as salts and methanol in the aqueous
	phase. There are several fugacity models that can adequately describe
	the aqueous phase for systems of hydrocarbons and water. However,
	when salts, alcohols, and glycols are added to the system, most fugacity
	models fail to account for proper interactions. In this work, we
	present an aqueous phase fugacity model using a modified Helgeson
	[Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 52 (1988) 2009] equation of state combined
	with a Bromley [AIChE J. 19 (1973) 313] activity model. The Helgeson
	equation of state describes hydrocarbon-water systems, while the
	Bromley activity model accounts for interactions within the aqueous
	phase when salts and methanol are added. The advantage of this model
	is that the aqueous phase fugacity can be described more accurately
	than with the approach of using cubic equations of state intended
	for hydrocarbons, so that, for example, salting out can be predicted.

	for systems containing electrolyte and non-electrolyte inhibitors,

	equilibria data have been published for such systems together with
	a new model for predicting gas hydrate equilibria. This paper compares
	gas hydrate-phase equilibria predictions with published data for
	systems containing methanol and sodium chloride. Predictions are
	made from a simplified version of the model recently published by
	Ballard and Sloan, which uses separate equations of state for the
	hydrocarbon, hydrate and aqueous phase. Model predictions have been
	compared with data measured between 1 and 70 MPa and up to a combined
	inhibitor concentration of 29 mol\%. The model predicts the data
	from three different experimental groups on average within 11\% error
	in pressure. Both the data and model predictions show that hydrate
	equilibrium curve slope dP/dT increases with increasing inhibitor
	concentration. This effect is more pronounced in the model predictions
	than the data. It is concluded that the simplified model discussed
	here predicts current data for hydrate equilibria with mixed inhibitors
	with reasonable accuracy, but more high-pressure hydrate data are
	needed to resolve differences between model and data for high concentrations
	of inhibitor. Use of the full model by Ballard and Sloan is still
	recommended though, especially for predictions of sII hydrates. (c)

	charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP)
	of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including
	formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by
	AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs)
	are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC
	charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting
	to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of >2700 molecules. Most organic
	functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as
	an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems.
	The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to
	handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck
	Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through
	comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies
	of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell
	et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond
	energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to
	within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and
	for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation
	from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation
	for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to
	within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests,
	AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient
	above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the
	AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to
	HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field
	in computer simulations involving organic small molecules.}

	with the NH3+ and CO2- groups which predominates in aqueous solution
	and in the crystal. All of our attempts to find the zwitterionic
	species in the isolated state failed, with the result that a hydrogen
	atom from the positively charged N-terminus ammonium group transferred
	either to one of the oxygens of the carboxylate group of the C-terminus

	Hence we conclude that the zwitterionic species of LeuE is not stable

	to be found in the isolated state can be compared to the measured
	VA, VCD and Raman spectra of LeuE in non-polar solvents to identify
	which conformer or conformers of LeuE are present in these media.
	Characteristic features in the VCD spectra are more sensitive to
	conformational changes than those in either the VA or Raman spectra,
	similar to the characteristic features in electronic circular dichroism
	spectra with respect to those in the UV-vis electronic absorption
	spectra. Finally, we have also attempted to stabilize the zwitterionic
	species by treating the aqueous environment by using a continuum
	solvent approach, the Onsager model. Here we found that the zwitterionic
	species is now stable. The neutral species in an aqueous environment
	was also modelled by the continuum solvent approaches to determine
	the relative stability of these two species in this new aqueous environment.
	Here the relative energy of the zwitterionic species is higher than
	neutral species, in contradiction to experiment. Hence the use of
	explicit water molecules plus either this or another continuum model
	to treat the bulk water environment is necessary to make the zwitterionic
	species more stable than the neutral species. We are pursuing explicit
	water molecules to treat LeuE in this environment. 0953-8984}

experimental ranges, and to exhibit gas-phase monohydrate energies in reasonable agreement

ions are ca. 1 kcal/mol. For the halides, this is the first self-consistent set of parameters that

These quasi-exact references allow us to quantify the accuracy of standard all-electron basis sets that are believed to be highly accurate for molecules, such as Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs), all-electron numeric atom-centered orbitals (NAOs), and full-potential augmented plane wave (APW) methods. We show that NAOs are able to achieve the so-called chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) for the typical basis set sizes used in applications, for both total and atomization energies. For GTOs, a triple-ζ quality basis has mean errors of ∼10 kcal/mol in total energies, while chemical accuracy is almost reached for a quintuple-ζ basis. Due to systematic error cancellations, atomization energy errors are reduced by almost an order of magnitude, placing chemical accuracy within reach also for medium to large GTO bases, albeit with significant outliers. In order to check the accuracy of the computed densities, we have also investigated the dipole moments, where in general only the largest NAO and GTO bases are able to yield errors below 0.01 D. The observed errors are similar across the different functionals considered here. }

An explicit hydrogen-bonding term is included in the model to account for the effects of charge transfer. The model parameters were optimized to density, configurational energy, pair correlation function, and the dielectric constant of water under ambient conditions, as well as the minimum gas-phase dimer energy. Molecular dynamics and Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate the new model with respect to the thermodynamic and transport properties over a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. Good agreement between model predictions and experimental data was found for most of the properties studied. The new model yields better performance relative to the majority of existing models and outperforms the BK3 model, which is one of the best polarizable models, for vapor-liquid equilibrium properties, whereas the new model is not better than the BK3 model for representation of other properties. The model can be efficiently simulated with the thermalized Drude oscillator algorithm, resulting in computational costs only 3 times higher than those of the nonpolarizable TIP4P/2005 model, whereas having significantly improved properties. Because it involves only a single Drude oscillator site, the new model is significantly faster than polarizable models with multiple sites. With the explicit inclusion of hydrogen-bond interactions, the model may provide a better description of the phase behavior of aqueous mixtures. }

abstract = {Covalent and noncovalent interactions dominate most compounds in the condensed phase and gas phase. For a classical diatomic molecule CO, it is usually regarded as a triple-bond system with one dative bond. In this work, the photoelectron velocity-map imaging spectra of the CS and PbS anions were first measured. The two interactions have been intuitively understood by a comparative investigation of electrostatic potential (ESP) and bond features in CO, CS, and PbS. It is suggested that both electrostatic and dative covalent interactions compete in CO molecules, while dative covalent interaction prevails in CS molecules and electrostatic interaction dominates in PbS molecules. As a consequence, CO has a very small dipole moment (∼0.1 D) compared to the large dipole moment in CS (>1.8 D) and PbS (>4 D). It is indicated that the electron affinity value increases with the increasing dipole moment in the order of CO < CS < PbS. In addition, intriguing ESP with negative bond-ends and positive bond-cylindrical-surface in CO is also revealed by comparing with that in CS and PbS. In the latter, the two molecules present opposite ESP maps. Molecular orbital analyses indicate surprising participation of Pb 5d orbitals in the Pb–S chemical bonding although Pb belongs to main-group elements. Further bond analyses using electron localization function, natural resonance theory, and bond order methods suggest that covalence is dominant in CS and ionicity is a major component in PbS, but somewhere in between for CO molecules. By a comparative study in this work, the CS molecule is also revealed as a promising ligand molecule for the transition-metal coordination chemical synthesis.

Abstract = {{Equilibrium thermodynamics of a short beta-hairpin are studied using
   unbiased all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations in
   explicit solvent. An exploratory analysis of the free energy landscape
   of the system is provided in terms of various structural
   characteristics, for both the folded and unfolded ensembles. We find
   that the favorable interactions between the ends introduced by the
   tryptophan cap, along with the flexibility of the turn region, explain
   the remarkable stability of the folded state. Charging of the N termini
   results in effective roughening of the free energy landscape and
   stabilization of non-native contacts. Folding-unfolding dynamics are
   further discussed using a set of 2413 independent molecular dynamics
   simulations, 2 ns to 20 ns long, at the melting temperature of the
   beta-hairpin. A novel method for the construction of Markov models
   consisting of an iterative refinement of the discretization in reduced
   dimensionality is presented and used to generate a detailed kinetic
   network of the system. The hairpin is found to fold heterogeneously on
   sub-microsecond timescales, with the relative position of the tryptophan
   side chains driving the selection of the specific pathway.}},

	the hydration potential for proteins. Parameters of the hydration
	potential for ice were developed with the assumption that the free

	the free energy of AFP-ice binding. This study is consistent with

	of AFP-ice complex is nearly impossible. Molecular modeling studies
	of AFPs' interaction with ice surface is therefore invaluable. Early
	models of AFP-ice interaction suggested H-bond as the primary driving
	force behind such interaction. Recent experimental evidence, however,
	suggested that hydrophobic interactions could be the main contributor
	to AFP-ice association. All computational studies published to date
	were carried out to verify the H-bond model, and no works attempting
	to verify the hydrophobic interaction model have been published.
	In this work, we Monte Carlo-minimized complexes of several AFPs
	with ice taking into account nonbonded interactions, H-bonds, and
	the hydration potential for proteins. Parameters of the hydration
	potential for ice were developed with the assumption that the free
	energy of the water-ice association should be close to zero at equilibrium
	melting temperature. Our calculations demonstrate that desolvation
	of hydrophobic groups in the AFPs upon their binding to the grooves
	at the ice surface is indeed the major stabilizing contributor to
	the free energy of AFP-ice binding. This study is consistent with
	available structural and mutation data on AFPs. In particular, it
	explains the paradoxical finding that substitution of Thr residues
	with Val does not affect the potency of winter flounder AFP whereas
	substitution with Ser abolished its antifreeze activity. 0961-8368}

  abstract = {Alkali (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) and halide (F-, Cl-, Br-, and I-) ions play an important role in many biological phenomena, roles that range from stabilization of biomolecular structure, to influence on biomolecular dynamics, to key physiological influence on homeostasis and signaling. To properly model ionic interaction and stability in atomistic simulations of biomolecular structure, dynamics, folding, catalysis, and function, an accurate model or representation of the monovalent ions is critically necessary. A good model needs to simultaneously reproduce many properties of ions, including their structure, dynamics, solvation, and moreover both the interactions of these ions with each other in the crystal and in solution and the interactions of ions with other molecules. At present, the best force fields for biomolecules employ a simple additive, nonpolarizable, and pairwise potential for atomic interaction. In this work, we describe our efforts to build better models of the monovalent ions within the pairwise Coulombic and 6-12 Lennard-Jones framework, where the models are tuned to balance crystal and solution properties in Ewald simulations with specific choices of well-known water models. Although it has been clearly demonstrated that truly accurate treatments of ions will require inclusion of nonadditivity and polarizability (particularly with the anions) and ultimately even a quantum mechanical treatment, our goal was to simply push the limits of the additive treatments to see if a balanced model could be created. The applied methodology is general and can be extended to other ions and to polarizable force-field models. Our starting point centered on observations from long simulations of biomolecules in salt solution with the AMBER force fields where salt crystals formed well below their solubility limit. The likely cause of the artifact in the AMBER parameters relates to the naive mixing of the Smith and Dang chloride parameters with AMBER-adapted {\AA}qvist cation parameters. To provide a more appropriate balance, we reoptimized the parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential for the ions and specific choices of water models. To validate and optimize the parameters, we calculated hydration free energies of the solvated ions and also lattice energies (LE) and lattice constants (LC) of alkali halide salt crystals. This is the first effort that systematically scans across the Lennard-Jones space (well depth and radius) while balancing ion properties like LE and LC across all pair combinations of the alkali ions and halide ions. The optimization across the entire monovalent series avoids systematic deviations. The ion parameters developed, optimized, and characterized were targeted for use with some of the most commonly used rigid and nonpolarizable water models, specifically TIP3P, TIP4PEW, and SPC/E. In addition to well reproducing the solution and crystal properties, the new ion parameters well reproduce binding energies of the ions to water and the radii of the first hydration shells.},

	on water is studied theoretically. A key aspect of the on-water rate
	phenomenon is the chemistry between water and reactants that occurs
	at an oil-water phase boundary. In particular, the structure of water
	at the oil-water interface of an oil emulsion, in which approximately
	one in every four interfacial water molecules has a free ({''}dangling{''})
	OH group that protrudes into the organic phase, plays a key role
	in catalyzing reactions via the formation of hydrogen bonds. Catalysis
	is expected when these OH's form stronger hydrogen bonds with the
	transition state than with the reactants. In experiments more than
	a 5 orders of magnitude enhancement in rate constant was found in
	a chosen reaction. The structural arrangement at the ``oil-water{''}
	interface is in contrast to the structure of water molecules around
	a small hydrophobic solute in homogeneous solution, where the water
	molecules are tangentially oriented. The latter implies that a breaking
	of an existing hydrogen-bond network in homogeneous solution is needed
	in order to permit a catalytic effect of hydrogen bonds, but not
	for the on-water reaction. Thereby, the reaction in homogeneous aqueous
	solution is intrinsically slower than the surface reaction, as observed
	experimentally. The proposed mechanism of rate acceleration is discussed
	in light of other on-water reactions that showed smaller accelerations
	in rates. To interpret the results in different media, a method is
	given for comparing the rate constants of different rate processes,
	homogeneous, neat and on-water, all of which have different units,
	by introducing models that reduce them to the same units. The observed
	deuterium kinetic isotope effect is discussed briefly, and some experiments
	are suggested that can test the present interpretation and increase

Abstract = {{Veterinary antibiotics may find their way into the aquatic environment

   Fenbendazole is a benzimidazole anthelmintic that is widely used in
   veterinary medicine. To evaluate the potential ecological risk of
   fenbendazole, we examined the molecular and biochemical responses of
   biomarker genes such as heat shock proteins (HSPs), cytochrome P450
   (CYP450), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and hemoglobins (Hbs) in
   Chironomus riparius for long periods. The expression of HSP70, HSP40,
   HSP90 and CYP450 in C riparius increased significantly after exposure to
   all concentrations of fenbendazole evaluated, while the levels of GST
   and HbA only increased in C riparius exposed to relatively high
   concentrations of fenbendazole (30 mu g L(-)1). HbB expression did not
   differ significantly between the control and treatment groups. Exposure
   to 30 mu g L(-1) fenbendazole had significant effects on the survival,
   growth, sex balance of emergent adults and development of mouthpart
   deformity in C riparius. These results should constitute an important
   contribution to the understanding of the toxicology of fenbendazole in C
   riparius. Moreover, the responses of the biomarker genes also provide
   valuable information that will aid in understanding the effects of
   fenbendazole in aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

	The method is general and computationally efficient for obtaining

	calculations, and the solvent is treated explicitly with classical
	OPLS potential functions. The interaction between the quantum and

	partial charges for the solute atoms that are derived from the AM1
	wave function via the CM1A procedure of Cramer and Truhlar. The new
	methodology is tested through computation of free energies of hydration
	of thirteen diverse organic molecules, the medium dependence of the
	conformational equilibria for 1,2-dichloroethane and furfural, the
	acceleration of the Claisen rearrangement of allyl vinyl ether in

	The new method is demonstrated by studying the ion-induced nucleation
	of supersaturated methanol and acetonitrile vapors by benzene molecular
	ions, The benzene ions are generated by R2PI using the benzene's
	A(1g) --> B-2u 6(0)(1) resonance transition. The measurements are
	carried out in a thermal diffusion cloud chamber. The nucleation
	count vs wavelength exhibits a characteristic peak at 258.9 nm, which
	matches the mass spectrum obtained by R2PI of benzene in a high-pressure
	mass spectrometric source. The observed nucleation count in supersaturated
	methanol vapor increases by about 20\% for benzene cations as compared
	to negative ions, which suggests an apparent enhancement for the

Furthermore, we find that post-CCSD(T) contributions increase linearly with the size of the n-alkane, indicating that they will reach~1 kcal/mol for n-decane (C10H22) and~2 kcal/mol for n-icosane (C20H42). These results are significant since today CCSD(T)/CBS-type methods are being applied to hydrocarbons of increasing size and are assumed to give \{TAEs\} with chemical accuracy for these systems. "

  abstract = {The separation of membrane protein complexes can be divided into two
	categories. One category, which is operated on a relatively large
	scale. aims to purify the membrane protein complex from membrane
	fractions while retaining its native form, mainly to characterize
	its nature. The other category aims to analyze the constituents of
	the membrane protein complex, usually on a small scale. Both of these
	face the difficulty of isolating the membrane protein complex without
	interference originating from the hydrophobic nature of membrane
	proteins or from the close association with membrane lipids. To overcome
	this difficulty, many methods have been employed. Crystallized membrane
	protein complexes are the most successful example of the former category.
	In these purification methods, special efforts are made in the steps
	prior to the column chromatography to enrich the target membrane
	protein complexes. Although there are specific aspects for each complex,
	the most popular method for isolating these membrane protein complexes
	is anion-exchange column chromatography, especially using weak anion-exchange
	columns. Another remarkable trend is metal affinity column chromatography,
	which purifies the membrane protein complex as an intact complex
	in one step. Such protein complexes contain subunit proteins which
	are genetically engineered so as to include multiple-histidine tags
	at carboxyl- or amino-termini. The key to these successes for multi-subunit
	complex isolation is the idea of keeping the expression at its physiological
	level, rather than overexpression. On the other hand, affinity purification
	using the Fv fragment, in which a Strep tag is genetically introduced,
	is ideal because this method does not introduce any change to the
	target protein. These purification methods supported by affinity
	interaction can be applied to minor membrane protein complexes in
	the membrane system. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and blue native (BN)
	electrophoresis have also been employed to prepare membrane protein
	complexes. Generally, a combination of two or more chromatographic
	and/or electrophoretic methods is conducted to separate membrane
	protein complexes. IEF or BN electrophoresis followed by 2nd dimension
	electrophoresis serve as useful tools for analytical demand. However,
	some problems still exist in the 2D electrophoresis using IEF. To
	resolve such problems, many attempts have been made, e.g. introduction
	of new chaotropes, surfactants, reductants or supporting matrices.
	This review will focus in particular on two topics: the preparative
	methods that achieved purification of membrane protein complexes
	in the native (intact) form. and the analytical methods oriented
	to resolve the membrane proteins. The characteristics of these purification
	and analytical methods will be discussed along with plausible future
	developments taking into account the nature of membrane protein complexes.

	of such a system, many important structural and dynamic parameters

	approaches allow the development of a high-resolution model of bilayer
	processes. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
	(DMPC) bilayers to model the creation of bilayer gaps-a common process
	in bilayer patterning-and to analyze their structure and dynamics.
	We propose a model for gap formation in which the bilayer edges form
	metastable micelle-like structures on a nanosecond timescale. Molecules
	near edges structurally resemble lipids in ungapped bilayers but
	undergo small-scale motions more rapidly. These data suggest that
	lipids may undergo rapid local rearrangements during membrane fusion,
	facilitating the formation of fusion intermediates thought key to
	the infection cycle of viruses such as influenza, Ebola, and HIV.},

Abstract = {{Benzimidazoles have been widely used since the 1960s as anthelmintic
   agents in veterinary and human medicine and as antifungal agents in
   agriculture. More recently, selected benzimidazole derivatives were
   shown to be active in vitro against two protozoan parasites, Trichomonas
   vaginalis and Giardia lamblia, and clinical studies with AIDS patients
   have suggested that microsporidia are susceptible as well. Here, eve
   first present in vitro susceptibility data for T. vaginalis and G.
   lamblia using an expanded set of benzimidazole derivatives. Both
   parasites were highly susceptible to four derivatives, including
   mebendazole, flubendazole, and fenbendazole (50\% inhibitory
   concentrations of 0.005 to 0.16 mu g/ml). These derivatives also had
   lethal activity that was time dependent: 90\% of T. vaginalis cells
   failed to recover following a 20-h exposure to mebendazole at 0.17 mu
   g/ml. G. lamblia, but not T. vaginalis, was highly susceptible to five
   additional derivatives. Next, we examined in vitro activity of
   benzimidazoles against additional protozoan parasites: little or no
   activity was observed against Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania major,
   and Acanthamoeba polyphaga. Since the microtubule protein beta-tubulin
   has been identified as the benzimidazole target in helminths and fungi,
   potential correlations between benzimidazole activity and beta-tubulin
   sequence were examined. This analysis included partial sequences
   (residues 108 to 259) from the organisms mentioned above, as well as the
   microsporidia Encephalitozoon hellem and Encephalitozoon cuniculi and
   the sporozoan Cryptosporidium parvum. beta-tubulin residues Glu-198 and,
   in particular, Phe-200 are strong predictors of benzimidazole
   susceptibility; both are present in Encephalitozoon spp. but absent in
   C. parvum.}},

	The observations show that large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns,

	and air-sea temperature gradients. During summer, temperature inversions
	and weak air-sea temperature gradients limit atmosphere-ocean coupling.
	In contrast, relatively low static stability and strong air-sea gradients
	during early fall permit upward turbulent fluxes of moisture and
	heat and increased low cloud formation over newly open water. Because

  abstract = {A vital constituent of a virus is its protein shell, called the viral
	capsid, that encapsulates and hence provides protection for the viral
	genome. Assembly models are developed for viral capsids built from
	protein building blocks that can assume different local bonding structures
	in the capsid. This situation occurs, for example, for viruses in
	the family of Papovaviridae, which are linked to cancer and are hence
	of particular interest for the health sector. More specifically,
	the viral capsids of the (pseudo-) T = 7 particles in this family
	consist of pentamers that exhibit two different types of bonding
	structures. While this scenario cannot be described mathematically
	in terms of Caspar-Klug theory (Caspar D L D and Klug A 1962 Cold
	Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 27 1), it can be modelled via tiling
	theory (Twarock R 2004 J. Theor. Biol. 226 477). The latter is used
	to encode the local bonding environment of the building blocks in
	a combinatorial structure, called the assembly tree, which is a basic
	ingredient in the derivation of assembly models for Papovaviridae
	along the lines of the equilibrium approach of Zlotnick (Zlotnick
	A 1994 J. Mol. Biol. 241 59). A phase space formalism is introduced
	to characterize the changes in the assembly pathways and intermediates
	triggered by the variations in the association energies characterizing
	the bonds between the building blocks in the capsid. Furthermore,
	the assembly pathways and concentrations of the statistically dominant
	assembly intermediates are determined. The example of Simian virus
	40 is discussed in detail. 1478-3967}

  abstract = {Gag, the major structural protein of retroviruses such as HIV-1, comprises
	a series of domains connected by flexible linkers. These domains
	drive viral assembly by mediating multiple interactions between adjacent
	Gag molecules and by binding to viral genomic RNA and host cell membranes.
	Upon viral budding, Gag is processed by the viral protease to liberate
	distinct domains as separate proteins. The first two regions of Gag
	are MA, a membrane-binding module, and CA, which is a two-domain
	protein that makes important Gag-Gag interactions, forms the cone-shaped
	outer shell of the core (the capsid) in the mature HIV-1 particle,
	and makes an important interaction with the cellular protein cyclophilin
	A (CypA). Here, we report crystal structures of the mature CA N-terminal
	domain (CA(133)(N)-(278)) and a MA-CA(N) fusion (Gag(1-278)) at resolutions/R-free
	values of 1.9 angstrom/25.7\% and 2.2 angstrom/25.8\%, respectively.
	Consistent with earlier studies, a comparison of these structures
	indicates that processing at the MA-CA junction causes CA to adopt
	an N-terminal, beta-hairpin conformation that seems to be required
	for capsid morphology and viral infectivity. In contrast with an
	NMR study (Tang, C., et al. (2002) Nat. Struct. Biol. 9, 537-543),
	structural overlap reveals only small relative displacements for
	helix 6, which is located between the, beta-hairpin and the CypA-binding
	loop. These observations argue against the proposal that CypA binding
	is coupled with, beta-hairpin formation and support an earlier surface
	plasmon resonance study (Yoo, S., et al. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 269,
	780-795), which concluded that, beta-hairpin formation and CypA-binding

	the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph.
	Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been
	studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct.
	All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly
	clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light
	(LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus
	group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes
	revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological
	differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight
	newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes
	for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates)
	and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns
	of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution.
	There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes.
	They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction,
	to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates
	by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic
	analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method
	to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene.
	Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes
	involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are
	found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes
	defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes,
	helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus.
	Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify
	highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple
	pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles,
	especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport
	that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core.
	Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout
	the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains
	and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the ``leaves
	of the tree,'' between the most closely related strains. Finally,
	the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome
	comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus
	genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing
	the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and
	the wild.},

	by 1 ns REX-CPHMD titration simulations of 10 proteins, which exhibit
	anomalously large pKa shifts for the carboxylate and histidine side
	chains. The experimental pKa values of these proteins are reliably
	reproduced with a root-mean-square error ranging from 0.6 unit for
	proteins containing few buried ionizable side chains to 1.0 unit
	or slightly higher for proteins containing ionizable side chains
	deeply buried in the core and experiencing strong charge-charge interactions.
	This unprecedented level of agreement with experimental benchmarks
	for the de novo calculation of pKa values suggests that the CPHMD
	method is maturing into a practical tool for the quantitative prediction
	of protein ionization equilibria, and this, in turn, opens a door
	to atomistic simulations of a wide variety of pH-coupled conformational
	phenomena in biological macromolecules such as protein folding or
	misfolding, aggregation, ligand binding, membrane interaction, and
	catalysis. 0006-2960}

	with minimal energies for a small number of molecules. We identified
	topologically different structures close to the absolute energy minimum
	of the system by calculating overlap integrals and enumerating hydrogen
	bonds. Starting from the dimer, we found increasing number of topologically
	different, low-energy arrangements for the trimer(3), the tetramer(6),
	the pentamer(6), and the hexamer(9). We studied simple models with
	polarizable point dipole. These were the BSV model [ J. Brodholt
	et al., Mol. Phys. 86, 149 (1995) ], the DC model [ L. X. Dang and
	T. M. Chang, J. Chem. Phys. 106, 8149 (1997) ], and the GCP model
	[ P. Paricaud et al., J. Chem. Phys. 122, 244511 (2005) ]. As an
	alternative the SWM4-DP and the SWM4-NDP charge-on-spring models
	[ G. Lamoureux et al., Chem. Phys. Lett. 418, 245 (2006) ] were also
	investigated. To study the impact of polarizability restricted to
	the plane of the molecule we carried out calculations for the SPC-FQ
	and TIP4P-FQ models, too [ S. W. Rick et al., J. Chem. Phys. 101,
	6141 (1994) ]. In addition to them, justified by their widespread
	use even for near critical or surface behavior calculations, we identified
	clusters for five nonpolarizable models of ambient water, SPC/E [
	H. J. C. Berendsen et al., J. Phys. Chem. 91, 6269 (1987) ], TIP4P
	[ W. L. Jorgensen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 79, 926 (1983) ], TIP4P-EW
	[ H. W. Horn et al., J. Chem. Phys. 120, 9665 (2004) ], and TIP4P/2005
	[ J. L. F. Abascal and C. Vega, J. Chem. Phys. 123, 234505 (2005)
	]. The fifth was a five-site model named TIP5P [ M. W. Mahoney and
	W. L. Jorgensen, J. Chem. Phys. 112, 8910 (2000) ]. To see the impact
	of the vibrations we studied the flexible SPC model. [ K. Toukan
	and A. Rahman, Phys. Rev. B 31, 2643 (1985) ]. We evaluated the results
	comparing them with experimental data and quantum chemical calculations.
	The position of the negative charge in the models plays a crucial
	role. In this respect models with SPC geometry provided structures
	different from the TIP4P-type potentials, including polarizable ones.
	The TIP4P variants form configurations similar to one another. Results
	for TIP4P-EW and for TIP4P/2005 were especially close to each other
	in every respect. This is also true for the BSV and the DC pair.
	The charge-on-spring models (SWM4-DP and SWM4-NDP) are also very
	similar to each other, despite the sign exchange of charges on the
	spring particle and the oxygen. The spherical polarization of water
	is crucial. Due to the planar polarization of the SPC-FQ and the
	TIP4P-FQ models, they prefer planar arrangements contrary to other
	polarizable models and quantum chemical calculations. The tetrahedral
	geometry of TIP5P stabilizes additional clusters with peculiar geometries
	and small O-O distances. Inclusion of vibrations causes only insignificant
	changes in the characteristic geometries but decreases the internal
	energy relative to its reference rigid version. Comparing with quantum
	mechanical calculations the GCP model provided the best overall results.},

	liquid water. The gas-phase clusters of SPC/E and TIP3P models show

	calculated their geometrical features. We determined angles formed
	by the HO bonds of the molecules with OO vectors and with the normal
	vector of the OOO plane in the selected trimers. Our results showed
	that, despite high temperature, the SPC/E and TIP3P water contains
	larger number of planar arrangements than other TIP4P-type models.
	Although structural differences presented in this study are small,
	they are accurately detectable. These results weaken the reliability

  OPTabstract = {To estimate accurately the density of water over a wide range of temperatures
	with a density maximum at 4$^o$C is one of the most stringent tests
	of molecular models. The shape of the curve influences the ability
	to describe critical properties and to predict the freezing temperature.
	While it was demonstrated that with a proper parameter fit nonpolarizable
	models can approximate this behavior accurately, it is much more
	difficult to do this for polarizable models. We provide a short overview
	of $\rho$-T diagrams for existing models, then we give an explanation
	of this difficulty. We present a version of the BK model [A. Baranyai
	and P. T. Kiss, J. Chem. Phys. 133, 144109 (2010)10.1063/1.3490660;
	A. Baranyai and P. T. Kiss, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 234110 (2011)]10.1063/1.3670962
	which is capable to predict the density of water over a wide range
	of temperature. The BK model uses the charge-on-spring method with
	three Gaussian charges. Since the experimental dipole moment and
	the geometry is fixed, and the quadrupole moment is approximated
	by a least mean square procedure, parameters of the repulsion and
	dispersive attraction forces remained as free tools to match experimental
	properties. Relying on a simplified but plausible justification,
	the new version of the model uses repulsion and attraction as functions
	of the induced dipole moment of the molecule. The repulsive force
	increases, while the attractive force decreases with the size of
	the molecular dipole moment. At the same time dipole moment dependent
	dispersion forces are taking part in the polarization of the molecule.
	This scheme iterates well and, in addition to a reasonable density-temperature
	function, creates dipole distributions with accurate estimation of
	the dielectric constant of the liquid.},

	the free energy for liquid water and hexagonal ice (Ih) at 1 bar.
	We used the TIP4P and the SPC/E models as reference systems of the
	TI. The studied models severely underestimate the experimental melting
	point of ice Ih. The calculated freezing points of the models are
	the following: COS/G2, 215 K; COS/G3, 149 K; SWM4-DP, 186K; BKd1,
	207 K; BKd2, 213 K; BKd3, 233 K. The freezing temperature of the
	SWM4-NDP system is certainly below 120 K. It might even be that the
	water phase is more stable than the ice Ih at 1 bar in the full temperature
	range. The COS/B2 model melts below 100 K. The best result was obtained
	for the BKd3 model which indicates that correct description of the
	(T-$\rho$) curve improves the estimation of the freezing point. We
	also determined and compared the densities of high-pressure polymorphs
	of ice for these models.},

We systematically derive expressions for the pressure and show that despite the lack of explicit pairwise additivity, the pressure formula for po- larizable models is identical with that of nonpolarizable ones. However, a strict condition for using this formula is that the induced dipole should be in perfect mechanical equilibrium prior to pressure calculation. The perfect convergence of induced dipoles ensures conservation of energy as well. We demonstrate using more cumbersome but exact methods that the derived expressions for the polar- izable model of water provide correct numerical results. We also show that the inaccuracy caused by imperfect convergence of the induced dipoles correlates with the inaccuracy of the calculated pressure.}

One of the two charges of the ions is fixed to the center of the particle, while the other is connected to this charge by a harmonic spring to express polarization. Polarizability is taken from quantum chemical calculations. The repulsion between different species is expressed by the combining rule of Kong [J. Chem. Phys. 59, 2464 (1972)]. Our primary target was the hydration free energy of ions which is correct within the error of calculations. We calculated water-ion clusters up to 6 water molecules, and, as a crosscheck, we determined the density and internal energy of alkali-halide crystals at ambient conditions with acceptable accuracy. The structure of hydrated ions was also discussed.}

abstract = { The fidelity of combustion simulations is strongly dependent on the accuracy of the underlying thermochemical properties for the core combustion species that arise as intermediates and products in the chemical conversion of most fuels. High level theoretical evaluations are coupled with a wide-ranging implementation of the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) approach to obtain well-validated high fidelity predictions for the 0 K heat of formation for a large set of core combustion species. In particular, high level ab initio electronic structure based predictions are obtained for a set of 348 C, N, O, and H containing species, which corresponds to essentially all core combustion species with 34 or fewer electrons. The theoretical analyses incorporate various high level corrections to base CCSD(T)/cc-pVnZ analyses (n = T or Q) using H2, CH4, H2O, and NH3 as references. Corrections for the complete-basis-set limit, higher-order excitations, anharmonic zero-point energy, core-valence, relativistic, and diagonal Born-Oppenheimer effects are ordered in decreasing importance. Independent ATcT values are presented for a subset of 150 species. The accuracy of the theoretical predictions is explored through (i) examination of the magnitude of the various corrections, (ii) comparisons with other high level calculations, and (iii) through comparison with the ATcT values. The estimated 2σ uncertainties of the three methods devised here, ANL0, ANL0-F12, and ANL1, are in the range of ±1.0-1.5 kJ/mol for single-reference and moderately multireference species, for which the calculated higher order excitations are 5 kJ/mol or less. In addition to providing valuable references for combustion simulations, the subsequent inclusion of the current theoretical results into the ATcT thermochemical network is expected to significantly improve the thermochemical knowledge base for less-well studied species. }

	scaling of the ab initio data, guided by the comparison of multidimensional
	nuclear quantum energy levels with experimental data. The resulting

	and 61 freely adjusted parameters and are combined with a four parameter
	monomer potential of generalized Poschl-Teller type. Various minimum
	energy paths and cuts are investigated. Major improvements over earlier
	HF dimer potentials are demonstrated via multidimensional solutions
	of the nuclear Schrodinger equation. Comparison with other high level
	ab initio calculations and with various experimental data reveals
	very good overall consistency. The new potential suggests strong
	Coriolis coupling in the librational degrees of freedom. Best estimates

	functional and the 6-31G* basis set (B3LYP/6-31G*). In aqueous solution
	the dominant state of LALA is the zwitterionic form, while its neutral
	form is dominant in vacuo. Attempts to locate or determine a gas-phase
	zwitterionic species failed. That is, on the B3LYP/6-31G* potential
	energy surface, there is no barrier to proton transfer from the positively
	charged ammonium group to the negatively charged carboxylate group,
	or from the ammonium group to the adjacent carbonyl oxygen and from
	the amide nitrogen to the carboxylate group. To stabilize the zwitterion,
	we modelled the system by adding explicit water molecules and by
	placing the zwitterion within a sphere surrounded by a medium with
	a dielectric constant of 78.5, that is, within the Onsager continuum
	model, where the recommended cavity radius is obtained from a solute
	volume calculation. The zwitterionic species is only stable in the
	presence of water at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. This makes it imperative
	to include water molecules to model the zwitterionic species of LALA,
	peptides and amino acids at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Finally, the
	zwitterionic structure stabilized by explicit water molecules has
	also been modelled within the Onsager theory. Here the Onsager model
	represents the effects due to the bulk water and the explicit water
	molecules stand for the effect due to direct H-bonding between the
	zwitterion and the solvent, that is, the first solvation shell. We
	used molecular dynamics simulations utilizing the CHARMm force field
	to produce structural input for the subsequent quantum-mechanical
	simulations. The structures determined using various methods to model
	the LALA zwitterionic form in aqueous solution were compared. We
	were able to find additional stable structures for LALA by adding
	water molecules and optimizing it which could not be obtained by
	using the Onsager theory. This shows that one must be careful when
	using continuum models to study peptides and proteins or other methods
	which do not take into account the explicit interactions between
	the solute and the first solvent shell. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

First, we briefly examine currently used molecular mechanical force fields and the current status of intermolecular forces as viewed by quantum mechanical approaches. Next, we demonstrate how some components of quantum mechanical energy are effectively incorporated into classical molecular mechanical force fields. Finally, we assess the modeling methods of one such energy component‚Äîpolarization energy‚Äîand present an overview of polarizable force fields and their current applications. Incorporating polarization effects into current force fields paves the way to developing potentially more accurate, though more complex, parameterizations that can be used for more realistic molecular simulations.}

  abstract = {The electrospray ionization (ESI) charge state distribution of proteins
	is highly sensitive to the protein structure in solution. Unfolded
	conformations generally form higher charge states than tightly folded
	structures. The current study employs a minimalist molecular dynamics
	model for simulating the final stages of the ESI process in order
	to gain insights into the physical reasons underlying this empirical
	relationship. The protein is described as a string of 27 beads (``residues''),
	9 of which are negatively charged and represent possible protonation
	sites. The unfolded state of this bead string is a random coil, whereas
	the native conformation adopts a compact fold. The ESI process is
	simulated by placing the protein inside a solvent droplet with a
	2.5 nm radius consisting of 1600 Lennard-Jones particles. In addition,
	the droplet contains 14 protons which are modeled as highly mobile
	point charges. Disintegration of the droplet rapidly releases the
	protein into the gas phase, resulting in average charge states of
	4.8+ and 7.4+ for the folded and unfolded conformation, respectively.
	The protonation probabilities of individual residues in the folded
	state reveal a characteristic pattern, with values ranging from 0.2
	to 0.8. In contrast, the protonation probabilities of the unfolded
	protein are more uniform and cover the range from 0.8 to 1.0. The
	origin of these differences can be traced back to a combination of
	steric and electrostatic effects. Residues exhibiting a small accessible
	surface area are less likely to capture a proton, an effect that
	is exacerbated by partial electrostatic shielding from nearby positive
	residues. Conversely, sites that are sterically exposed are associated
	with electrostatic funnels that greatly increase the likelihood of
	protonation. Unfolding enhances the steric and electrostatic exposure
	of protonation sites, thereby causing the protein to capture a greater
	number of protons during the droplet disintegration process. 1520-6106}

Journal = {{Toxicol.}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{249-261}},
Abstract = {{Hundreds of thousands of people are dying around the world each year
   from the effects of the use, or misuse, of pesticides. This paper
   reviews the different options to reduce availability of the most
   hazardous chemicals, focusing on issues in developing countries.
   Emphasis is placed on the fatal poisoning cases and hence the focus on
   self-harm cases. Overall, it is argued here that restricting access to
   the most hazardous pesticides would be of paramount importance to reduce
   the number of severe acute poisoning cases and case-fatalities and would
   provide greater opportunities for preventive programmes to act
   effectively. The aim should be to achieve an almost immediate phasing
   out of the WHO Classes I and 11 pesticides through national policies and
   enforcement. These short-term aims will have to be supported by medium-
   and long-term objectives focusing on the substitution of pesticides with
   safe and cost-effective alternatives, possibly guided by the
   establishment of a Minimum Pesticide List, and the development of future
   agricultural practices where pesticide usage is reduced to an absolute
   minimum. Underlying factors that make individuals at risk for self-harm
   include domestic problems, alcohol or drug addiction, emotional
   distress, depression, physical illness, social isolation or financial
   hardship. These should be addressed through preventive health programmes
   and community development efforts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

	substitutions may result from the depletion of the E22-K28 salt bridge,
	which destabilizes the bend structure. Alternately, the E22 mutations
	may affect longer-range interactions outside the 21-30 segment that
	can impact the aggregation of A beta. Substituting at residue D23,
	on the other hand, leads to the formation of a turn rather than a

	modes of a subsystem of interest (essential subspace) is coupled
	to a higher temperature, with the remainder of the system staying

	the replica framework permits efficient approximate ensemble-preserving

	Around room temperature, small organic solutes and hydrophobic amino
	acids have low solubilities in water and the hydrophobic effect is

	be maximally stable around room temperature. While this fundamental
	paradigm has been expected, it has not actually been shown to hold.
	Toward this goal, we have collected and analyzed experimental thermodynamic
	data for 31 proteins that show reversible two-state folding reversible
	arrow unfolding transitions at or near neutral pH. Twenty-six of
	these are unique, and 20 of the 26 are maximally stable around room
	temperature irrespective of their structural properties, the melting
	temperature, or the living temperatures of their source organisms.
	Their average temperature of maximal stability is 293 +/- 8 K (20
	+/- 8 degreesC). These proteins differ in size, fold, and number
	of domains, hydrophobic folding units, and oligomeric states. They
	derive from the cold-loving psychrophiles, from mesophiles, and from
	thermophiles. Analysis of the single-domain proteins present in this
	set shows that the variations in their thermodynamic parameters are
	correlated in a way which may explain the adaptation of the proteins
	to the living temperatures of the organisms from which they derive.
	The average energetic contribution of the individual amino acids
	toward protein stability decreases with an increase in protein size,
	suggesting that there may be an upper limit for protein maximal thermodynamic
	stability. For the remaining proteins, deviation of the maximal stability
	temperatures from room temperature may be due to greater uncertainties
	in their heat capacity change (DeltaC(p)) values, a weaker hydrophobic
	effect, and/or a stronger electrostatic contribution.},

abstract= {Accurate and fast evaluation of electrostatic interactions in molecular systems is one of the most challenging tasks in the rapidly advancing field of macromolecular chemistry and drug design. Electrostatic interactions are of crucial importance in biological systems. They are well represented by quantum mechanical methods; however, such calculations are computationally expensive. In this study, we have evaluated the University of Buffalo Pseudoatom Databank (UBDB)1,2 approach for approximation of electrostatic properties of macromolecules and their complexes. We selected the S663 and JSCH-20054 data sets (208 molecular complexes in total) for this study. These complexes represent a wide range of chemical and biological systems for which hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions play important roles. Reference electrostatic energies were obtained directly from wave functions at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory using the SAPT (Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory) scheme for calculation of electrostatic contributions to total intermolecular interaction energies. Electrostatic energies calculated on the basis of the UBDB were compared with corresponding reference results. Results were also compared with energies computed using a point charge model from popular force fields (AM1-BCC and RESP used in AMBER and CGenFF from CHARMM family). The energy trends are quite consistent (R2~ 0.98) for the UBDB method as compared to the AMBER5 and CHARMM force field methods6(R2~ 0.93 on average). The RSMEs do not exceed 3.2 kcal mol-1 for the UBDB and are in the range of 3.7-7.6 kcal mol-1 for the point charge models. We also investigated the discrepancies in electrostatic potentials and magnitudes of dipole moments among the tested methods. This study shows that estimation of electrostatic interaction energies using the UBDB databank is accurate and reasonably fast when compared to other known methods, which opens potential new applications to macromolecules.}

abstract = { In this article, we present a parallel implementation of point dipole-based polarizable force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). The smooth particle mesh Ewald technique is combined with two optimal iterative strategies, namely, a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver and a Jacobi solver in conjunction with the direct inversion in the iterative subspace for convergence acceleration, to solve the polarization equations. We show that both solvers exhibit very good parallel performances and overall very competitive timings in an energy and force computation needed to perform a MD step. Various tests on large systems are provided in the context of the polarizable AMOEBA force field as implemented in the newly developed Tinker-HP package, which is the first implementation of a polarizable model that makes large-scale experiments for massively parallel PBC point dipole models possible. We show that using a large number of cores offers a significant acceleration of the overall process involving the iterative methods within the context of SPME and a noticeable improvement of the memory management, giving access to very large systems (hundreds of thousands of atoms) as the algorithm naturally distributes the data on different cores. Coupled with advanced MD techniques, gains ranging from 2 to 3 orders of magnitude in time are now possible compared to nonoptimized, sequential implementations, giving new directions for polarizable molecular dynamics with periodic boundary conditions using massively parallel implementations. }

	A quantitative band shape analysis of the spectra associated with
	the OH stretching mode of ethanol has been done using IR and Raman
	activities determined by ab initio calculations on small oligomers.
	Such a methodology allows the quantification of the degree of hydrogen
	bonding ($\eta$), and both IR and Raman techniques lead to comparable

	ethanol. The degree of hydrogen bonding ($\eta$) is found to be relatively
	constant above the critical density and strongly diminishes below

	measurements reported using IR spectroscopy. The disagreement observed
	with NMR experiments has been critically discussed.}

  abstract = {A simple treatment for incorporating induced polarization in computer
	simulations is formulated on the basis of the classical Drude oscillator
	model. In this model, electronic induction is represented by the
	displacement of a charge-carrying massless particle attached to a
	polarizable atom under the influence of the local electric field.
	The traditional self-consistent field (SCF) regime of induced polarization
	is reproduced if these auxiliary particles are allowed to relax instantaneously
	to their local energy minima for any given fixed configuration of
	the atoms in the system. In practice, such treatment is computationally
	prohibitive for generating molecular dynamics trajectories because
	the electric field must be recalculated several times iteratively
	to satisfy the SCF condition, and it is important to seek a more
	efficient way to simulate the classical Drude oscillator model. It
	is demonstrated that a close approximation to the SCF regime can
	be simulated efficiently by considering the dynamics of an extended
	Lagrangian in which a small mass is attributed to the auxiliary particles,
	and the amplitude of their oscillations away from the local energy
	minimum is controlled with a low-temperature thermostat. A simulation
	algorithm in this modified two-temperature isobaric-isothermal ensemble
	is developed. The algorithm is tested and illustrated using a rigid
	three-site water model with one additional Drude particle attached
	to the oxygen which is closely related to the polarizable SPC model
	of Ahlstrom [Mol. Phys. 68, 563 (1989)]. The tests with the extended
	Lagrangian show that stable and accurate molecular dynamics trajectories
	for large integration time steps (1 or 2 fs) can be generated and
	that liquid properties equivalent to SCF molecular dynamics can be
	reproduced at a fraction of the computational cost.}

	The permanent charge distribution of the water molecule is represented

	by introducing a classical charged Drude particle attached to the
	oxygen by a harmonic spring. The oxygen site carries an equal and

	of an extended Lagrangian in which a small mass is attributed to
	the Drude particles. It is parametrized to reproduce the salient
	properties of liquid water under ambient conditions. The optimal

	and high level ab initio calculations. The polarizability of the
	optimal model is 1.04 Angstrom(3), which is smaller than the experimental
	value of 1.44 Angstrom(3) in the gas phase. It is likely that such
	a reduced molecular polarizability, which is essential to reproduce

	has recently become accessible from both computation and experiment.
	To validate molecular dynamics (MD) at the submicrosecond timescale
	against experiment we present microsecond MD simulations in 10 different
	force-field configurations for two globular proteins, ubiquitin and
	the gb3 domain of protein G, for which extensive NMR data is available.
	We find that the reproduction of the measured NMR data strongly depends
	on the chosen force field and electrostatics treatment. Generally,
	particle-mesh Ewald outperforms cut-off and reaction-field approaches.
	A comparison to measured J-couplings across hydrogen bonds suggests
	that there is room for improvement in the force-field description
	of hydrogen bonds in most modern force fields. Our results show that
	with current force fields, simulations beyond hundreds of nanoseconds
	run an increased risk of undergoing transitions to nonnative conformational
	states or will persist within states of high free energy for too
	long, thus skewing the obtained population frequencies. Only for
	the AMBER99sb force field have such transitions not been observed.
	Thus, our results have significance for the interpretation of data
	obtained with long MD simulations, for the selection of force fields
	for MD studies and for force-field development. We hope that this
	comprehensive benchmark based on NMR data applied to many popular
	MD force fields will serve as a useful resource to the MD community.
	Finally, we find that for gb3, the force-field AMBER99sb reaches
	comparable accuracy in back-calculated residual dipolar couplings

We describe a methodology for detecting solidlike NaCl clusters (potential nuclei) and following their evolution in time until they achieve nucleation (which is very rare) or dissolve back into solution. Through an analysis of cluster lifetimes and multiple nucleation events, we demonstrate that cluster size is not the only property that influences cluster stability and the probability of achieving nucleation. We introduce a parameter called cluster crystallinity, which is a measure of the solidlike order in a particular cluster. We show that cluster order (as measured by this parameter) has a strong influence on the lifetime and nucleation probability of clusters of equal sizes, with the lifetime and probability of nucleation increasing with increasing crystallinity. These observations remain true for clusters as small as six ions, showing that the structural factors are important even at the earliest stages of crystal birth. }

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are employed to investigate crystal nucleation and growth in oversaturated aqueous LiF solutions. Results obtained for a range of temperatures provide evidence that the rate of crystal growth is determined by a substantial energy barrier (∼49 kJ mol−1) related to the loss of water from the ion hydration shells. Employing direct MD simulations, we do not observe spontaneous nucleation of LiF crystals at 300 K, but nucleation is easily observable in NVT simulations at 500 K. This contrasts with the NaCl case, where crystal nucleation is directly observed in similar simulations at 300 K. Based on these observations, together with a detailed analysis of ion clustering in metastable LiF solutions, we argue that the ion dehydration barrier also plays a key role in crystal nucleation. The hydration of the relatively small Li+ and F− ions strongly influences the probability of forming large, crystal-like ion clusters, which are a necessary precursor to nucleation. This important factor is not accounted for in classical nucleation theory.}

Basis set and quadrature grid issues are also considered. The general aim of the study is to work out which functionals are generally well applicable and robust to describe the energies of molecules. In summary{,} we recommend on the GGA level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 functionals. The best meta-GGA is oTPSS-D3 although meta-GGAs represent in general no clear improvement compared to numerically simpler GGAs. Notably{,} the widely used B3LYP functional performs worse than the average of all tested hybrids and is also very sensitive to the application of dispersion corrections. We discourage its usage as a standard method without closer inspection of the results{,} as it still seems to be often done nowadays. Surprisingly{,} long-range corrected exchange functionals do in general not perform better than the corresponding standard hybrids. However{,} the [small omega]B97X-D functional seems to be a promising method. The most robust hybrid is Zhao and Truhlar{'}s PW6B95 functional in combination with DFT-D3. If higher accuracy is required{,} double-hybrids should be applied. The corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 variants are the most accurate and robust functionals of the entire study. Additional calculations with MP2 and and its spin-scaled variants SCS-MP2{,} S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 revealed that double-hybrids in general outperform those. Only SCS-MP2 can be recommended{,} particularly for reaction energies. We suggest its usage when a large self-interaction error is expected that prohibits usage of double-hybrids. Perdews{'} metaphoric picture of Jacob{'}s Ladder for the classification of density functionals{'} performance could unbiasedly be confirmed with GMTKN30.

An automated procedure, ForceBalance, is used to adjust model parameters to enforce agreement with ab initio-derived results for water clusters and experimental data for a variety of liquid phase properties across a broad temperature range. The values reported here for the new AMOEBA14 water model represent a substantial improvement over the previous AMOEBA03 model. The AMOEBA14 model accurately predicts the temperature of maximum density and qualitatively matches the experimental density curve across temperatures from 249 to 373 K. Excellent agreement is observed for the AMOEBA14 model in comparison to experimental properties as a function of temperature, including the second virial coefficient, enthalpy of vaporization, isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion coefficient, and dielectric constant. The viscosity, self-diffusion constant, and surface tension are also well reproduced. In comparison to high-level ab initio results for clusters of 2-20 water molecules, the AMOEBA14 model yields results similar to AMOEBA03 and the direct polarization iAMOEBA models. With advances in computing power, calibration data, and optimization techniques, we recommend the use of the AMOEBA14 water model for future studies employing a polarizable water model. }

  abstract = {Aviation emissions contribute to the radiative forcing (RF) of climate.
	Of importance are emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) nitrogen oxides
	(NO.), aerosols and their precursors (soot and sulphate), and increased
	cloudiness in the form of persistent linear contrails and induced-cirrus
	cloudiness. The recent Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental
	Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) quantified aviation's RF contribution
	for 2005 based upon 2000 operations data. Aviation has grown strongly
	over the past years, despite world-changing events in the early 2000s;
	the average annual passenger traffic growth rate was 5.3\% yr(-1)
	between 2000 and 2007, resulting in an increase of passenger traffic
	of 38\%. Presented here are updated values of aviation RF for 2005
	based upon new operations data that show an increase in traffic of
	22.5\%, fuel use of 8.4\% and total aviation RF of 14\% (excluding
	induced-cirrus enhancement) over the period 2000-2005. The lack of
	physical process models and adequate observational data for aviation-induced
	cirrus effects limit confidence in quantifying their RF contribution.
	Total aviation RF (excluding induced cirrus) in 2005 was similar
	to 55 mW m(-2) (23-87 mW m(-2), 90\% likelihood range), which was
	3.5\% (range 1.3-10\%. 90\% likelihood range) of total anthropogenic
	forcing. Including estimates for aviation-induced cirrus RF increases
	the total aviation RF in 2005-78 mW m(-2) (38-139 mW m(-2), 90\%
	likelihood range), which represents 4.9\% of total anthropogenic
	forcing (2-14\%, 90\% likelihood range). Future scenarios of aviation
	emissions for 2050 that are consistent with IPCC SIZES A1 and B2
	scenario assumptions have been presented that show an increase of
	fuel usage by factors of 2.7-3.9 over 2000. Simplified calculations
	of total aviation RF in 2050 indicate increases by factors of 3.0-4.0
	over the 2000 value, representing 4-4.7\% of total RF (excluding
	induced cirrus). An examination of a range of future technological
	options shows that substantive reductions in aviation fuel usage
	are possible only with the introduction of radical technologies.
	Incorporation of aviation into an emissions trading system offers
	the potential for overall (i.e., beyond the aviation sector) CO2
	emissions reductions. Proposals exist for introduction of such a
	system at a European level, but no agreement has been reached at
	a global level. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Aviation alters the composition of the atmosphere globally and can
	thus drive climate change and ozone depletion. The last major international
	assessment of these impacts was made by the Intergovernmental Panel
	on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1999. Here, a comprehensive updated assessment
	of aviation is provided. Scientific advances since the 1999 assessment
	have reduced key uncertainties, sharpening the quantitative evaluation,
	yet the basic conclusions remain the same. The climate impact of
	aviation is driven by long-term impacts from CO2 emissions and shorter-term
	impacts from non-CO2 emissions and effects, which include the emissions
	of water vapour, particles and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The present-day
	radiative forcing from aviation (2005) is estimated to be 55 mW m(-2)
	(excluding cirrus cloud enhancement), which represents some 3.5\%
	(range 1.3-10\%, 90\% likelihood range) of current anthropogenic
	forcing, or 78 mW m(-2) including cirrus cloud enhancement, representing
	4.9\% of current forcing (range 2-14\%, 90\% likelihood range). According
	to two SRES-compatible scenarios, future forcings may increase by
	factors of 3-4 over 2000 levels, in 2050. The effects of aviation
	emissions of CO2 on global mean surface temperature last for many
	hundreds of years (in common with other sources), whilst its non-CO2
	effects on temperature last for decades. Much progress has been made
	in the last ten years on characterizing emissions, although major
	uncertainties remain over the nature of particles. Emissions of NOx
	result in production of ozone, a climate warming gas, and the reduction
	of ambient methane (a cooling effect) although the overall balance
	is warming, based upon current understanding. These NOx emissions
	from current subsonic aviation do not appear to deplete stratospheric
	ozone. Despite the progress made on modelling aviation's impacts
	on tropospheric chemistry, there remains a significant spread in
	model results. The knowledge of aviation's impacts on cloudiness
	has also improved: a limited number of studies have demonstrated
	an increase in cirrus cloud attributable to aviation although the
	magnitude varies: however, these trend analyses may be impacted by
	satellite artefacts. The effect of aviation particles on clouds (with
	and without contrails) may give rise to either a positive forcing
	or a negative forcing: the modelling and the underlying processes
	are highly uncertain, although the overall effect of contrails and
	enhanced cloudiness is considered to be a positive forcing and could
	be substantial, compared with other effects. The debate over quantification
	of aviation impacts has also progressed towards studying potential
	mitigation and the technological and atmospheric tradeoffs. Current
	studies are still relatively immature and more work is required to
	determine optimal technological development paths, which is an aspect
	that atmospheric science has much to contribute. In terms of alternative
	fuels, liquid hydrogen represents a possibility and may reduce some
	of aviation's impacts on climate if the fuel is produced in a carbon-neutral
	way: such fuel is unlikely to be utilized until a `hydrogen economy'
	develops. The introduction of biofuels as a means of reducing CO2
	impacts represents a future possibility. However, even over and above
	land-use concerns and greenhouse gas budget issues, aviation fuels
	require strict adherence to safety standards and thus require extra
	processing compared with biofuels destined for other sectos, where
	the uptake of such fuel may be more beneficial in the first instance.

abstract = { Metal ions play a vital role in many biological processes. An important factor in these processes is the dynamics of exchange between ion bound-water molecules and the bulk. Although structural and dynamical properties of labile waters bound to metal ions, such as Na+ and Ca2+, can be elucidated using molecular dynamics simulations, direct evaluation of rates of exchange of waters rigidly bound to high charge density Mg2+, has been elusive. Here, we report a universal relationship, allowing us to determine the water exchange time on metal ions as a function of valence and hydration radius. The proposed relationship, which covers times spanning 14 orders of magnitude, highlights the ultrasensitivity of water lifetime to the ion size, as exemplified by divalent ions, Ca2+ (∼100 ps) and Mg2+ (∼1.5 μs). We show that even when structures, characterized by radial distributions are similar, a small difference in hydration radius leads to a qualitatively different (associative or dissociative) mechanism of water exchange. Our work provides a theoretical basis for determination of hydration radius, which is critical for accurately modeling the water dynamics around multivalent ions, and hence in describing all electrostatically driven events such as ribozyme folding and catalysis. }

Under supercooled conditions down to 255 K{,} the oxygen K-edge measured by X-ray Raman scattering suggests an increase of tetrahedral order similar to the conventional temperature effect observed in non-supercooled water. Compton profile differences indicate contributions beyond the theoretically predicted temperature effect and provide a deeper insight into local structural changes. These contributions suggest a decrease of the electron mean kinetic energy by 3.3 +/- 0.7 kJ (mol K)-1 that cannot be modeled within established water models. Our surprising results emphasize the need for water models that capture in detail the intramolecular structural changes and quantum effects to explain this complex liquid."}

abstract = { Empirical force fields seek to relate the configuration of a set of atoms to its energy, thus yielding the forces governing its dynamics, using classical physics rather than more expensive quantum mechanical calculations that are computationally intractable for large systems. Most force fields used to simulate biomolecular systems use fixed atomic partial charges, neglecting the influence of electronic polarization, instead making use of a mean-field approximation that may not be transferable across environments. Recent hardware and software developments make polarizable simulations feasible, and to this end, polarizable force fields represent the next generation of molecular dynamics simulation technology. In this work, we describe the refinement of a polarizable force field for DNA based on the classical Drude oscillator model by targeting quantum mechanical interaction energies and conformational energy profiles of model compounds necessary to build a complete DNA force field. The parametrization strategy employed in the present work seeks to correct weak base stacking in A- and B-DNA and the unwinding of Z-DNA observed in the previous version of the force field, called Drude-2013. Refinement of base nonbonded terms and reparametrization of dihedral terms in the glycosidic linkage, deoxyribofuranose rings, and important backbone torsions resulted in improved agreement with quantum mechanical potential energy surfaces. Notably, we expand on previous efforts by explicitly including Z-DNA conformational energetics in the refinement. }

abstract = { The structure and dynamics of DNA are governed by a sensitive balance between base stacking and pairing, hydration, and interactions with ions. Force field models that include explicit representations of electronic polarization are capable of more accurately modeling the subtle details of these interactions versus commonly used additive force fields. In this work, we validate our recently refined polarizable force field for DNA based on the classical Drude oscillator model, in which electronic degrees of freedom are represented as negatively charged particles attached to their parent atoms via harmonic springs. The previous version of the force field, called Drude-2013, produced stable A- and B-DNA trajectories on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds, but deficiencies were identified that included weak base stacking ultimately leading to distortion of B-DNA duplexes and unstable Z-DNA. As a result of extensive refinement of base nonbonded terms and bonded parameters in the deoxyribofuranose sugar and phosphodiester backbone, we demonstrate that the new version of the Drude DNA force field is capable of simulating A- and B-forms of DNA on the microsecond time scale and the resulting conformational ensembles agree well with a broad set of experimental properties, including solution X-ray scattering profiles. In addition, simulations of Z-form duplex DNA in its crystal environment are stable on the order of 100 ns. The revised force field is to be called Drude-2017. }

abstract  ="The issues of electronic polarizability in molecular dynamics simulations are discussed. We argue that the charges of ionized groups in proteins{,} and charges of ions in conventional non-polarizable force fields such as CHARMM{,} AMBER{,} GROMOS{,} etc should be scaled by a factor about 0.7. Our model explains why a neglect of electronic solvation energy{,} which typically amounts to about a half of total solvation energy{,} in non-polarizable simulations with un-scaled charges can produce a correct result; however{,} the correct solvation energy of ions does not guarantee the correctness of ion-ion pair interactions in many non-polarizable simulations. The inclusion of electronic screening for charged moieties is shown to result in significant changes in protein dynamics and can give rise to new qualitative results compared with the traditional non-polarizable force field simulations. The model also explains the striking difference between the value of water dipole [small mu ] [similar] 3D reported in recent ab initio and experimental studies with the value [small mu ]eff [similar] 2.3D typically used in the empirical potentials{,} such as TIP3P or SPC/E. It is shown that the effective dipole of water can be understood as a scaled value [small mu ]eff = [small mu ]/[surd radical]?el{,} where ?el = 1.78 is the electronic (high-frequency) dielectric constant of water. This simple theoretical framework provides important insights into the nature of the effective parameters{,} which is crucial when the computational models of liquid water are used for simulations in different environments{,} such as proteins{,} or for interaction with solutes."}

	viral structural dynamics and the inhibition of such dynamics with
	an antiviral agent, WIN 52084. Viral capsid digestion fragments resulting
	from proteolytic time-course experiments provided structural information
	in good agreement with the HRV14 three-dimensional crystal structure.
	As expected, initial digestion fragments included peptides from the
	capsid protein VP1. This observation was expected because VP1 is
	the most external viral protein. Initial digestion fragments also
	included peptides belonging to VP4, the most internal capsid protein.
	The mass spectral results together with x-ray crystallography data
	provide information consistent with a ``breathing'' model of the
	viral capsid. Whereas the crystal structure of HRV14 shows VP4 to
	be the most internal capsid protein, mass spectral results show VP4
	fragments to be among the first digestion fragments observed. Taken
	together this information demonstrates that VP4 is transiently exposed
	to the viral surface via viral breathing. Comparative digests of
	HRV14 in the presence and-absence of WIN 52084 revealed a dramatic
	inhibition of digestion. These results indicate that the binding
	of the antiviral agent not only causes local conformational changes
	in the drug binding pocket but actually stabilizes the entire viral
	capsid against enzymatic degradation. Viral capsid mass mapping provides
	a fast and sensitive method for probing viral structural dynamics
	as well as providing a means for investigating antiviral drug efficacy.

	for the stabilization of the P-hairpin. It is also found that the

	exhibits weak cooperativity, which is consistent with the experimental

Without fitting to any experimental information, the AFM models predict the hydration free energies of all 10 fluoride and chloride salts formed by these ions within 1.5\% of experimental references. The predicted hydration free energies for the 10 bromide and iodide salts are within 5-6\% of experimental references with the larger error likely due to the neglect of explicit treatment of polarization and charge transfer. An inconsistency in the treatment of the gas phase entropy term between experimental and theoretical approaches is discussed. A new simplified hydration free energy for the ions is reported for use as a more appropriate experimental reference for further theoretical studies. The simulations show different dipole alignments for the hydration waters of cations and anions. While hydration waters of small cations tend to align their molecular dipole toward the ion, the dipole of one of the water OH bonds is aligned with the field of an anion. }

abstract = { Organic matter is ubiquitous in the atmosphere. It can form coatings that directly influence both the physical and chemical properties of the atmospheric water droplets and can have important but nontrivial consequences of climate changes. To understand the effects of organic coatings on gas uptake by atmospheric water droplets, we studied the uptake of three common atmospheric gases (H2O, O3, and SO2) by benzoic acid (BA)- or lauric acid (LA)-coated water droplets in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy ΔF profiles for gas uptake by these coated systems were compared with the uncoated results in our previous work. We found that the changes in Coulomb energy dominate the changes in potential energy ΔU in the BA-coated systems, whereas the changes in Lennard-Jones energy play an important role in the LA-coated systems due to the long alkyl chains. We also found a clear positive correlation between the entropic contribution TΔS and the mobility of water and organic molecules. To study the dynamics and kinetics, we investigated how the organic coatings affect the mass accommodation coefficient α in nonequilibrium gas impinging runs. While the effects of the organic coating on α can be different for different gases, we found a general explanation for the change in α in terms of the relative positions of the air–organic interface and ΔF minimum. }

  abstract = {Hydrogen bond geometries and H-1 NMR chemical shifts of OHO hydrogen-bonded
	systems have been analyzed using an improved valence bond order model.
	This model predicts that the heavy atom hydrogen bond coordinate
	q(2) = r(1) + r(2) is a function of the proton coordinate q(1) =
	1/2(r(1) - r(2)), where r(1) and r(2) represent the OH and the HO
	distances. In the first part, it is shown that this correlation reproduces
	published equilibrium geometries of the Zundel cation H5O2+ as well
	as those of water clusters in the gas phase and embedded in the fullerene
	C180. Using the example of the water hexamer, it is shown that changing
	the level of calculation shifts the calculated geometries along the
	correlation curve, but not away from the curve. In order to take
	quantum zero-point vibrational effects (QZPVE) into account, an empirical
	correction is proposed. It is shown that this correction properly
	describes the calculated classical and quantum hydrogen bond geometries
	of compressed ice as well as calculated geometric H/D isotope effects.
	The improved valence bond order model is used to analyze a large
	number of OHO hydrogen bond geometries contained in the Cambridge
	Structural Database. In the second part, a relation between the geometries
	and the H-1 NMR chemical shieldings of OHO hydrogen bonded systems
	is established using the valence bond order model. GIAO calculations
	of the isolated symmetric Zundel cation where H is located in the
	hydrogen bond center show only a small dependence of the chemical
	shifts on the O center dot center dot center dot O distance. This
	result is rationalized in terms of neighbor group effects and deshielding
	in the naked proton. The consequence is that the H-1 NMR chemical
	shifts are not much affected by QZPVE. Calculations on water clusters
	indicate that the influence of the chemical environment of the OHO
	hydrogen bonds on their H-1 NMR chemical shifts is smaller for the
	strong hydrogen bond regime but large for the weak hydrogen bond
	regime. A simple chemical shift vs. q(1) relation is then used to
	calculate the average chemical shifts of water clusters in the regime
	of fast hydrogen bond exchange between hydrogen bonded and free OH
	groups. It is shown that average chemical shifts of about 6 ppm are
	possible as the clusters considered exhibit a broad distribution
	of stronger and weaker hydrogen bonds. The implications for water
	in organic solvents and for liquid water are discussed, based on
	published data on the H-1 chemical shift distribution in the latter.},

To perform more accurate modeling and simulations of halogenated molecules, in this study the polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator model was extended to both aliphatic and aromatic systems using halogenated ethane and benzene model compounds for the halogens F, Cl, Br, and I. The force field parameters were optimized targeting quantum mechanical dipole moments, water interactions, and molecular polarizabilities as well as experimental observables, including enthalpies of vaporization, molecular volumes, hydration free energies, and dielectric constants. The developed halogenated polarizable force field is capable of reproducing QM relative energies and geometries of both halogen bonds and halogen-hydrogen bond donor interactions at an unprecedented level due to the inclusion of a virtual particle and anisotropic atomic polarizability on the halogen and, notably, the inclusion of Lennard-Jones parameters on the halogen Drude particle. The model was validated on the basis of its ability to accurately reproduce pure solvent properties for halogenated naphthalenes and alkanes, including species analogous to those used as refrigerants. Accordingly, it is anticipated that the model will be applicable for the study of halogenated derivatives in CADD as well as in other chemical and biophysical studies. }

abstract = { Development of accurate force field parameters for molecular ions in the context of a polarizable energy function based on the classical Drude oscillator is a crucial step toward an accurate polarizable model for modeling and simulations of biological macromolecules. Toward this goal we have undertaken a hierarchical approach in which force field parameter optimization is initially performed for small molecules for which experimental data exists that serve as building blocks of macromolecular systems. Small molecules representative of the ionic moieties of biological macromolecules include the cationic ammonium and methyl substituted ammonium derivatives, imidazolium, guanidinium and methylguanidinium, and the anionic acetate, phenolate, and alkanethiolates. In the present work, parameters for molecular ions in the context of the Drude polarizable force field are optimized and compared to results from the nonpolarizable additive CHARMM general force field (CGenFF). Electrostatic and Lennard-Jones parameters for the model compounds are developed in the context of the polarizable SWM4-NDP water model, with emphasis on assuring that the hydration free energies are consistent with previously reported parameters for atomic ions. The final parameters are shown to be in good agreement with the selected quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental target data. Analysis of the structure of water around the ions reveals substantial differences between the Drude and additive force fields indicating the important role of polarization in dictating the molecular details of aqueous solvation. The presented parameters represent the foundation for the charged functionalities in future generations of the Drude polarizable force field for biological macromolecules as well as for drug-like molecules. }

  abstract = {Cyanobacteria, and the viruses ( phages) that infect them, are significant
	contributors to the oceanic `gene pool'(1,2). This pool is dynamic,
	and the transfer of genetic material between hosts and their phages(3-6)
	probably influences the genetic and functional diversity of both.
	For example, photosynthesis genes of cyanobacterial origin have been
	found in phages that infect Prochlorococcus(5,7) and Synechococcus(8,9),
	the numerically dominant phototrophs in ocean ecosystems. These genes
	include psbA, which encodes the photosystem II core reaction centre
	protein D1, and high-light-inducible ( hli) genes. Here we show that
	phage psbA and hli genes are expressed during infection of Prochlorococcus
	and are cotranscribed with essential phage capsid genes, and that
	the amount of phage D1 protein increases steadily over the infective
	period. We also show that the expression of host photosynthesis genes
	declines over the course of infection and that replication of the
	phage genome is a function of photosynthesis. We thus propose that
	the phage genes are functional in photosynthesis and that they may
	be increasing phage fitness by supplementing the host production
	of these proteins.},

	Furthermore, phage genomes have clearly been shaped by the acquisition

	expression of a host and phage, the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus
	MED4 and the T7-like cyanophage P-SSP7, during lytic infection, to
	gain insight into these co-evolutionary processes. Although most
	of the phage genome was linearly transcribed over the course of infection,
	four phage-encoded bacterial metabolism genes formed part of the
	same expression cluster, even though they are physically separated
	on the genome. These genes-encoding photosystem II D1 ( psbA), high-light
	inducible protein (hli), transaldolase (talC) and ribonucleotide
	reductase (nrd)-are transcribed together with phage DNA replication
	genes and seem to make up a functional unit involved in energy and
	deoxynucleotide production for phage replication in resource-poor
	oceans. Also unique to this system was the upregulation of numerous
	genes in the host during infection. These may be host stress response
	genes and/or genes induced by the phage. Many of these host genes
	are located in genome islands and have homologues in cyanophage genomes.
	We hypothesize that phage have evolved to use upregulated host genes,
	leading to their stable incorporation into phage genomes and their
	subsequent transfer back to hosts in genome islands. Thus activation
	of host genes during infection may be directing the co-evolution
	of gene content in both host and phage genomes.},

   nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a
   small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a

abstract = { In this paper, we investigate various numerical strategies to compute the direct space polarization energy and associated forces in the context of the point dipole approximation (including damping) used in polarizable molecular dynamics. We present a careful mathematical analysis of the algorithms that have been implemented in popular production packages and applied to large test systems. We show that the classical Jacobi Over-Relaxation method (JOR) should not be used as its convergence requires a proper value of the relaxation parameter, whereas other strategies should be preferred. On a single node, Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient methods (PCG) and Jacobi algorithm coupled with the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (JI/DIIS) provide reliable stability/convergence and are roughly twice as fast as JOR. Moreover, both algorithms are suitable for massively parallel implementations. The lower requirements in terms of processes communications make JI/DIIS the method of choice for MPI and hybrid OpenMP/MPI paradigms for real life tests. Furthermore, using a predictor step as a guess along a molecular dynamics simulation provides another inexpensive, yet very effective, form of convergence acceleration. Overall, two to three orders of magnitude in time can be gained compared to the initial JOR single node approach to the final PGC or JI/DIIS parallel one combined with the predictors MD refinements. Such a speedup traces a new route for the high performance implementation of polarizable molecular dynamics and therefore extends the applicability of the technique as it will facilitate future multiscale QM/MM/continuum computations. }

Recently, the finding that the dielectric permeability of liquids near solid/liquid interfaces is far from being constant but deviates strongly from the bulk value within several nanometers from the interface has raised the interest in a more fundamental understanding of the response properties near interfaces. As these questions are hard to study experimentally, reliable theoretical models are required. Here we describe a careful first-principles based reparametrization of nonpolarizable molecular mechanics force fields for a class of technological relevant organic chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents which are immiscible with water. For the solvent 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) we also present a new polarizable force field based on the Drude oscillator model. Its parametrization needs particular attention to avoid unphysical couplings between the internal torsional degree of freedom and the Drude oscillators, which could severely skew the response properties. The performance of this new set of force fields is critically assessed based on a comprehensive molecular dynamics study. }

This approach couples the Gaussian and Tinker suite of programs through a variational formalism allowing for a full self-consistent relaxation of both the AMOEBA induced dipoles and the DFT electron density at each MD step. As the DFT SCF cycles are the limiting factor in terms of computational efforts and MD stability, we focus on the latter aspect and compare the time-reversible BO (TR-BO) and the extended BO Lagrangian approaches (XL-BO) to the MD propagation. The XL-BO approach allows for stable, energy-conserving trajectories offering various perspectives for hybrid simulations using polarizable force fields. }

abstract = { Alchemical free energy calculations are an increasingly important modern simulation technique to calculate free energy changes on binding or solvation. Contemporary molecular simulation software such as AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, and SOMD include support for the method. Implementation details vary among those codes, but users expect reliability and reproducibility, i.e., for a given molecular model and set of force field parameters, comparable free energy differences should be obtained within statistical bounds regardless of the code used. Relative alchemical free energy (RAFE) simulation is increasingly used to support molecule discovery projects, yet the reproducibility of the methodology has been less well tested than its absolute counterpart. Here we present RAFE calculations of hydration free energies for a set of small organic molecules and demonstrate that free energies can be reproduced to within about 0.2 kcal/mol with the aforementioned codes. Absolute alchemical free energy simulations have been carried out as a reference. Achieving this level of reproducibility requires considerable attention to detail and package-specific simulation protocols, and no universally applicable protocol emerges. The benchmarks and protocols reported here should be useful for the community to validate new and future versions of software for free energy calculations. }

Structural order parameters provide two distinct estimates of the QLL widths, which are found to range from 6.0 to 7.8 Å, and depend on the facet and undercooling temperature. Above 260 K, the viscosity of the vapor-adjacent water layer is significantly less viscous than the solid-adjacent layer and is also lower than the viscosity of liquid water. }

	to curb climate change, but due to insignificant economic incentives
	to reduce usage of fossil fuels, not a lot of progress has been made
	by this route. This necessitates additional measures to reduce the
	occurrence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Here we used theoretical
	methods to study the solubility of carbon dioxide in ionic liquids
	(ILs) since sequestration of CO2 in ILs has been proposed as a possible
	technology for reducing the emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere. Ionic
	liquids form a class of solvents with melting temperatures below
	100 $^o$C and, due to very low vapor pressures, which are not volatile.
	We have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
	(C2mim) bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Tf2N) and its mixtures
	with carbon dioxide in order to investigate the CO2 concentration
	effect on the CO2-cation and CO2-anion interactions. A systematic
	investigation of CO2 concentration effects on resulting equilibrium
	liquid structure, and the local environment of the ions is provided.
	The Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) was used to determine
	the interaction energy for CO2-cation and CO2-anion complexes from
	uncorrelated structures derived from MD simulations. A spatial distribution
	function analysis demonstrates the specific interactions between
	CO2 and the ionic liquid. Our findings indicate that the total volume
	of the system increases with the CO2 concentration, with a molar
	volume of CO2 of about 0.038 L/mol, corresponding to liquid CO2 under
	a pressure of 100 bar. In other words, the IL effectively pressurizes
	the CO2 inside its matrix. The thermodynamics of CO2 solvation in
	C2 min-Tf2N were computed using free energy techniques, and the solubility
	of CO2 is found to be higher in this IL (-3.7 +/- 1 kcal/mol) than
	in water (+0.2 kJ/mol), predominantly due to anion-CO2 interactions.},

  abstract = { Different classes of ground electronic state pairwise interatomic interactions are referenced to a single canonical potential using explicit transformations. These approaches have been applied to diatomic molecules N2, CO, H2+, H2, HF, LiH, Mg2, Ca2, O2, the argon dimer, and one-dimensional cuts through multidimensional potentials of OC-HBr, OC-HF, OC-HCCH, OC-HCN, OC-HCl, OC-HI, OC-BrCl, and OC-Cl2 using accurate semiempirically determined interatomic Rydberg-Klein-Rees (RKR) and morphed intermolecular potentials. Different bonding categories are represented in these systems, which vary from van der Waals, halogen bonding, and hydrogen bonding to strongly bound covalent molecules with binding energies covering 3 orders of magnitude from 84.5 to 89 600.6 cm-1 in ground state dissociation energies. Such approaches were then utilized to give a unified perspective on the nature of bonding in the whole range of diatomic and intermolecular interactions investigated. }

	out that an operational definition of minimal cell does not define
	a single species, but rather a broad family of interrelated cell-like
	structures. The relevance of these researches, considering that the
	minimal cell should also correspond to the early simple cell in the
	origin of life and early evolution, is also explained. In addition,
	we present detailed data in relation to minimal genome, with observations
	cited by several authors who agree on setting the theoretical full-fledged
	minimal genome to a figure between 200 and 300 genes. However, further
	theoretical assumptions may significantly reduce this number (i.e.
	by eliminating ribosomal proteins and by limiting DNA and RNA polymerases
	to only a few, less specific molecular species). Generally, the experimental
	approach to minimal cells consists in utilizing liposomes as cell
	models and in filling them with genes/enzymes corresponding to minimal
	cellular functions. To date, a few research groups have successfully
	induced the expression of single proteins, such as the green fluorescence
	protein, inside liposomes. Here, different approaches are described

  abstract = {Synthetic biology as a broad and novel field has also a chemical branch:
	whereas synthetic biology generally has to do with bioengineering
	of new forms of life (generally bacteria) which do not exist in nature,
	`chemical synthetic biology' is concerned with the synthesis of chemical
	structures such as proteins, nucleic acids, vesicular forms, and
	other which do not exist in nature. Three examples of this `chemical
	synthetic biology' approach are given in this article. The first
	example deals with the synthesis of proteins that do not exist in
	nature, and dubbed as `the never born proteins' (NBPs). This research
	is related to the question why and how the protein structures existing
	in our world have been selected out, with the underlying question
	whether they have something very particular from the structural or
	thermodynamic point of view (for example, the folding). The NBPs
	are produced in the laboratory by the modern molecular biology technique,
	the phage display, so as to produce a very large library of proteins
	having no homology with known proteins. The second example of chemical
	synthetic biology has also to do with the laboratory synthesis of
	proteins, but, this time, adopting a prebiotic synthetic procedure,
	the fragment condensation of short peptides, where short means that
	they have a length that can be obtained by prebiotic methods for
	example, from the condensation of N-carboxy anhydrides. The scheme
	is illustrated and discussed, being based on the fragment condensation
	catalyzed by peptides endowed with proteolitic activity. Selection
	during chain growth is determined by solubility under the contingent
	environmental conditions, i.e., the peptides which result insoluble
	are eliminated from further growth. The scheme is tested preliminarily
	with a synthetic chemical fragment-condensation method and brings
	to the synthesis of a 44-residueslong protein, which has no homology
	with known proteins, and which has a stable tertiary folding. Finally,
	the third example, dubbed as `the minimal cell project'. Here, the
	aim is to synthesize a cell model having the minimal and sufficient
	number of components to be defined as living. For this purpose, liposomes
	are used as shell membranes, and attempts are made to introduce in
	the interior a minimal genome. Several groups all around the world
	are active in this field, and significant results have been obtained,
	which are reviewed in this article. For example, protein expression
	has been obtained inside liposomes, generally with the green fluorescent
	protein, GFP Our last attempts are with a minimal genome consisting
	of 37 enzymes, a set which is able to express proteins using the
	ribosomal machinery. These minimal cells are not yet capable of self-reproduction,
	and this and other shortcomings within the project are critically

	different matrixes, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic
	acid (sinapinic acid, SA), and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB). Statistical

	decomposition rate coefficient. Corresponding theoretical reaction
	rate coefficients were calculated based on the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus
	(RRKM) theory for different internal energies of the TMs. The internal
	energies of the ions were obtained by projecting the experimental
	rate coefficient values onto the theoretical curves obtained by the
	RRKM calculations. Molecular ions of the analytes showed decreasing
	survival yields and consequently increasing internal energies in
	the three matrixes in the following order: CHCA, SA, and DHB with
	``cold'', ``intermediate'', and ``hot'' characteristics, respectively.
	Qualitatively, this could be interpreted as a significant departure
	from earlier observations suggesting an opposite trend. The classification
	as hot and cold matrixes should be further qualified by accounting
	for the influence of laser pulse energy and the nature of the analyte.
	Higher laser pulse energy led to an elevated level of energy transferred
	to the analyte, which in turn resulted in a diminished survival yield
	of the analyte molecular ion. It is quite possible that the assignment
	of hot and cold reverses as the analyte or the laser energy changes.
	These findings can help predict the outcome of postsource decay experiments
	and clarify the concept of hot and cold matrixes in MALDI mass spectrometry.

	to the intermolecular forces than if this analysis were not performed.
	Direct comparison of neutron diffraction data and computer simulation
	results indicates that existing models of the molecular force field
	give a sensible description of the liquid structure, although there
	are some discrepancies which are not fully understood at this time.
	The question of whether this material can be regarded as an associated
	liquid, as it is frequently referred to, is discussed. All tests

	The results of these simulations are shown to compare well with recent
	neutron diffraction experiments using H/D isotope substitution [A.
	K. Soper and A. Luzar, J. Chem. Phys. 97, 1320 (1992)]. Even for
	the highly concentrated 1 DMSO: 2 H2O solution, the water hydrogen-hydrogen
	radial distribution function, g(HH)(r), exhibits the characteristic
	tetrahedral ordering of water-water hydrogen bonds. Structural information
	is further obtained from various partial atom-atom distribution functions,
	not accessible experimentally. The behavior of water radial distribution
	functions, g(OO)(r) and g(OH)(r) indicate that the nearest neighbor
	correlations among remaining water molecules in the mixture increase
	with increasing DMSO concentration. No preferential association of
	methyl groups on DMSO is detected. The pattern of hydrogen bonding
	and the distribution of hydrogen bond lifetimes in the simulated
	mixtures is further investigated. Molecular dynamics results show
	that DMSO typically forms two hydrogen bonds with water molecules.
	Hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules are longer lived
	than water-water hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond lifetimes determined
	by reactive flux correlation function approach are about 5 and 3
	ps for water-DMSO and water-water pairs, respectively, in 1 DMSO:
	2 H2O mixture. In contrast, for pure water, the hydrogen bond lifetime
	is about 1 ps. We discuss these times in light of experimentally
	determined rotational relaxation times. The relative values of the
	hydrogen bond lifetimes are consistent with a statistical (i.e.,
	transition state theory) interpretation.}

The influence of temperature and LiCl concentration on density; as well as the structures and transport properties of molten salts were investigated. The structures of molten mixtures were studied via an analysis of pair distribution functions and distribution of individual ion coordination numbers. Pair distribution functions suggest that interactions between unlike ions decrease with increases in LiCl content. The coordination number of Li+ ion increases as LiCl concentration increasing. An investigation of the diffusion coefficients suggests that the ionic diffusion coefficient increases with increasing LiCl concentration. The calculations also show that the Born-Mayer-Huggins potential together with the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method predicts positive temperature dependences for self-diffusion coefficients, and negative temperature dependences for viscosity of molten ternary mixtures. The simulation results agree with the experimental data available in the literature and the calculated results regarding mixing behavior follow the mixing rules for an ideal liquid."

For the ternary system, the density was calculated across the full composition and database was established. Furthermore, the structure simulation results revealed that the coordination of Li-Cl pair tended to be a distorted tetrahedron and the Na-Cl and K-Cl pairs tended to be an octahedron. The prediction of the properties was compared with available experiments and extrapolated analytical data, the deviations are acceptable. The temperature had no significant effects on the local structure and thermal conductivity. The results also showed that the Tosi−Fumi potential predicted positive temperature dependence of self-diffusion coefficients and ionic conductivity, and negative temperature dependence of the viscosity. In addition, the correlation between the local structure and transport properties was explored. The hydrodynamic radius of Li+ and K+ is similar in the ternary system, it can be found that whilst the K+ ion diffuses as an atomic species, the Li+ ion carries at least some of its coordinating Cl− ions in the diffusion process, giving the diffusing species a larger effective size than the bare ion."

	field developments, such as accurate treatment of implicit solvation
	for efficient conformational sampling and proper treatment of backbone
	interactions for secondary structure propensities. In this study,
	we first investigate the quality of several recently improved backbone
	interaction schemes in AMBER for folding simulations of a beta-hairpin
	peptide, and further study their influences on the peptide's folding
	mechanism. Due to the significant number of simulations needed for
	a thorough analysis of tested force fields, the implicit Poisson-Boltzmann
	solvent was used in all simulations. The chosen implicit solvent
	was found to be reasonable for studies of secondary structures based
	on a set of simulations of both alpha-helical and beta-hairpin peptides
	with the TIP3P explicit solvent as benchmark. Replica exchange molecular
	dynamics was also utilized for further efficient conformational sampling.
	Among the tested AMBER force fields, ff03 and a revised ff99 force
	field were found to produce structural and thermodynamic data in
	comparably good agreement with the experiment. However, detailed
	folding pathways, such as the order of backbone hydrogen bond zipping

  abstract = {A new interatomic potential for dissociative water was developed for
	use in molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations use a multibody
	potential, with both pair and three-body terms, and the Wolf summation
	method for the long-range Coulomb interactions. A major feature in
	the potential is the change in the short-range O-H repulsive interaction
	as a function of temperature and/or pressure in order to reproduce
	the density-temperature curve between 273 K and 373 at 1 atm, as
	well as high-pressure data at various temperatures. Using only the
	change in this one parameter, the simulations also reproduce room-temperature
	properties of water, such as the structure, cohesive energy, diffusion
	constant, and vibrational spectrum, as well as the liquid-vapor coexistence
	curve. Although the water molecules could dissociate, no dissociation
	is observed at room temperature. However, behavior of the hydronium
	ion was studied by introduction of an extra H+ into a cluster of
	water molecules. Both Eigen and Zundel configurations, as well as

Title = {{Measurement and modelling of tropospheric reactive halogen species over
   the tropical Atlantic Ocean}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{4611-4624}},
Abstract = {{Although tropospheric reactive halogen chemistry is well studied in
   coastal and polar environments, the presence of halogens over the open
   ocean environment has not been widely reported. The impacts of halogens
   on the tropical open ocean marine boundary layer (MBL), in particular,
   are not well characterised. This paper describes observations of iodine
   monoxide (IO) and bromine oxide (BrO) over eight months in the tropical
   open ocean MBL, on the north-eastern side of Sao Vicente (Cape Verde
   Islands, 16.85A degrees N, 24.87A degrees W). The highest BrO mixing
   ratio observed was 5.6 +/- 1 pmol mol(-1), while the maximum observed IO
   mixing ratio was 3.1 +/- 0.4 pmol mol(-1). The average values seen
   between 09:00-17:00 GMT were similar to 2.8 pmol mol(-1) for BrO and
   similar to 1.5 pmol mol(-1) for IO; these averages showed little
   variability over the entire campaign from November 2006 to June 2007. A
   1-dimensional chemistry and transport model is used to study the
   evolution of iodine species and quantify the combined impact of iodine
   and bromine chemistry on the oxidising capacity of the MBL. It appears
   that the measured fluxes of iodocarbons are insufficient to account for
   the observed levels of IO, and that an additional I atom source is
   required, possibly caused by the deposition of O-3 onto the ocean
   surface in the presence of solar radiation. Modelling results also show
   that the O-3 depletion observed at Cape Verde cannot be explained in the
   absence of halogen chemistry, which contributes similar to 45\% of the
   observed O-3 depletion at the height of measurements (10 m) during
   summer. The model also predicts that halogens decrease the hydroperoxy
   radical (HO2) concentration by similar to 14\% and increase the hydroxyl
   radical (OH) concentration by similar to 13\% near the ocean surface.
   The oxidation of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) by BrO takes place at a
   comparable rate to oxidation by OH in this environment. Finally, the
   potential of iodine chemistry to form new particles is explored and
   conditions under which particle formation could be important in the
   remote MBL are discussed.}},

	the overall enthalpies of disruption of contacts between the polar

	with their exposure to water. It appears that these enthalpies have
	opposite signs in the temperature range considered and change in
	opposite directions with increasing temperature. The enthalpy of
	transfer of non-polar groups from the protein interior into water
	is negative below 25$^o$C and positive above. The enthalpy of transfer
	of polar groups from the protein interior into water is positive
	at low temperatures and becomes negative at higher temperatures.
	Over the considered temperature range, however, the enthalpy of transfer
	of non-polar groups dominates. This results in a positive enthalpy
	of protein unfolding at elevated temperatures. The opposite sign
	and temperature dependence of the specific values of these two enthalpies
	for the considered proteins explains the experimentally observed
	convergence of the specific enthalpies of globular protein unfolding
	at about 130$^o$C.}

	estrogen analogues, phthalates, dioxins, perfluorinated compounds,
	and brominated flame retardants. These groups represent ubiquitous
	pollutants, of which some have circulated in the environment for
	more than 60 years. In this context, this review describes the chemical
	properties, the environmental fate, and the toxicological effects
	of these classes of pollutants on humans and animals, including an
	introductory section on the detoxification systems that are triggered

	amides, peptides, and related compounds}},
  journal = BTjcc,
  year = {1998},
  volume = {19},
  pages = {430--458},
  abstract = {As the field of biomolecular structure advances, there is an ever-growing
	need for accurate modeling of molecular energy surfaces to simulate
	and predict the properties of these important systems. To address
	this need, a second generation amide force field for use in simulations
	of small organics as well as proteins and peptides has been derived.
	The critical question of what accuracy can be expected from calculations
	in general, and with this class ii force field in particular, is
	addressed for structural, dynamic, and energetic properties. The
	force field is derived from a recent methodology we have developed
	that involves the systematic use of quantum mechanical observables.
	Systematic ab initio calculations were carried out for numerous configurations
	of 17 amide and related compounds. Relative energies and first and
	second derivatives of the energy of 638 structures of these compounds
	resulted in 140,970 ab initio quantum mechanical observables. The
	class II peptide quantum mechanical force field (QMFF), containing
	732 force constants and reference values, was parameterized against
	these observables. A major objective of this work is to help establish
	the role of anharmonicity and coupling in improving the accuracy
	of molecular force fields, as these terms have not yet become an
	agreed upon standard in the ever more extensive simulations being
	used to probe biomolecular properties. This has been addressed by
	deriving a class I harmonic diagonal force field (HDFF), which was
	fit to the same energy surface as the QMFF, thus providing an opportunity
	to quantify the effects of these coupling and anharmonic contributions.
	Both force field representations are assessed in terms of their ability
	to fit the observables. They have also been tested by calculating
	the properties of 11 stationary states of these amide molecules.
	Optimized structures, vibrational frequencies, and conformational
	energies obtained from the quantum calculations and from both the
	QMFF and the HDFF are compared. Several strained and derivatized
	compounds including urea, formylformamide, and butyrolactam are:
	included in these tests to assess the range of applicability (transferability)
	of the force fields. It was found that the class II coupled anharmonic
	force field reproduced the structures, energies, and vibrational
	frequencies significantly more faithfully than the class I harmonic
	diagonal force field. An important measure, rms energy deviation,
	was found to be 1.06 kcal/mol with the class II force field, and
	2.30 kcal/mol with the harmonic diagonal force field. These deviations
	represent the error in relative configurational energy differences
	for strained and distorted structures calculated with the force fields
	compared with quantum mechanics. This provides a measure of the accuracy
	that might be expected in applications where strain may be important
	such as calculating the energy of a system as it approaches a (rotational)
	barrier, in Ligand binding to a protein, or effects of introducing
	substituents into a molecule that may induce strain. Similar results
	were found for structural properties. Protein dynamics is becoming
	of ever-increasing interest, and, to simulate dynamic properties
	accurately, the dynamic behavior of model compounds needs to be well
	accounted for. To this end, the ability of the class I and class
	II force fields to reproduce the vibrational frequencies obtained
	from the quantum energy surface was assessed. An rms deviation of
	43 cm(-1) was achieved with the coupled anharmonic force field, as
	compared to 105 cm(-1) with the harmonic diagonal force field. Thus,
	the analysis presented here of the class II force field for the amide
	functional group demonstrates that the incorporation of anharmonicity
	and coupling terms in the force field significantly improves the
	accuracy and transferability with regard to the simulation of structural,
	energetic, and dynamic properties of amides. (C) 1998 John Wiley

	protein analysis that is a prerequisite for answering the questions

	in most electrospray regimes and affect the stream of ions introduced
	into the mass spectrometer. Fast time-lapse imaging of the Taylor
	cone throughout its evolution indicates the presence of a nodal line

	cycle (liquid accumulation, cone formation, ejection of a jet, relaxation)
	are established. Based on image analysis, apex velocities, curvatures,
	and opening angles are determined. During jet ejection, the apex
	velocity and the curvature exhibit singularities. Furthermore, the
	pulsation frequencies of the Taylor cone deformations are determined
	using Fourier analysis of light refraction measurements. The oscillation
	frequency of the electrospray current collected by the counter electrode
	shows close correlation to the cone deformations, providing the first
	direct evidence that links spray current oscillations to Taylor cone
	pulsation. Thus, monitoring the oscillation frequency throughout
	the spraying process and adjusting the spray parameters can be used

Importantly{,} there is only very modest computational overhead involved in computing >11 000 reaction energies compared to 140 atomization energies{,} since the rate-determining step for either benchmark is performing the same 140 quantum chemical calculations. The performance of commonly used electronic structure methods for the new database is analyzed. This allows investigating the relationship between the performances for atomization and reaction energy benchmarks based on an identical set of molecules. The atomization energy is found to be a weak predictor for the overall usefulness of a method. The performance of density functional approximations in light of the number of empirically optimized parameters used in their design is also discussed."}

	Small amounts of residual solvent have been shown to protect the
	protein, but temperature is important too, although it is not well
	understood how the latter affects structural details. Using molecular
	dynamics we have simulated four sparingly hydrated globular proteins
	(Trp-cage; Ctf, a C-terminal fragment of a bacterial ribosomal protein;
	ubiquitin; and lysozyme) in vacuum starting at temperatures ranging
	from 225 K to 425 K. For three of the proteins, our simulations show
	that a water layer corresponding to 3 angstrom preserves the protein
	structure in vacuum, up to starting temperatures of 425 K. Only Ctf
	shows minor secondary structural changes at lower starting temperatures.
	The structural conservation stems mainly from interactions with the
	surrounding water. Temperature scales in simulations are not directly
	translatable into experiments, but the wide temperature range in
	which we find the proteins to be stable is reassuring for the success
	of future single particle imaging experiments. The water molecules
	aggregate in clusters and form patterns on the protein surface, maintaining

	formulation of umbrella sampling along a helical coordinate, and
	from extensive and fully atomistic simulations we quantified the
	free-energy landscapes that underlie the sliding dynamics and dissociation
	kinetics for the LacI dimer. The resulting potential of mean force
	distributions show a fine structure with an amplitude of 1 k(B)T

	bp on average before making a microscopic dissociation. By combining
	the microscopic molecular-dynamics calculations with Brownian simulation
	including rotational diffusion from the microscopically dissociated
	state we estimate a macroscopic residence time of 48 ms at the same
	DNA segment and an in vitro sliding distance of 240 bp. The sliding
	distance is in agreement with previous in vitro sliding-length estimates.
	The in vitro prediction for the macroscopic residence time also compares
	favorably to what we measure by single-molecule imaging of nonspecifically

	reversible diffusion-influenced geminate recombination derived by
	Agmon and Weiss J. Chem. Phys. 91, 6937 1989. Agreement with diffusion
	theory is independent of the precise definition of the bound state.
	Given the water self-diffusion constant, this theory enables us to
	determine the dissociation and bimolecular recombination rate parameters
	for a water dimer. The theory is indispensable for obtaining the
	bimolecular rate coefficient. Interestingly, the activation energies
	obtained from the temperature dependence of these rate coefficients
	are similar, rather than differing by the hydrogen-bond HB strength.
	This suggests that recombination requires displacing another water
	molecule, which meanwhile occupied the binding site. Because these
	activation energies are about twice the HB strength, cleavage of
	two HBs may be required to allow pair separation. The autocorrelation
	function without the HB angular restriction yields a recombination
	rate coefficient that is larger than that for rebinding to all four
	tetrahedral water sites with angular restrictions, suggesting the
	additional participation of interstitial sites. Following dissociation,
	the probability of the pair to be unbound but within the reaction
	sphere rises more slowly than expected, possibly because binding
	to the interstitial sites delays pair separation. An extended diffusion
	model, which includes an additional binding site, can account for
	this behavior. }

abstract = { Understanding the reactivity and spectroscopy of aqueous solutions at the atomistic level is crucial for the elucidation and design of chemical processes. However, the simulation of these systems requires addressing the formidable challenges of treating the quantum nature of both the electrons and nuclei. Exploiting our recently developed methods that provide acceleration by up to 2 orders of magnitude, we combine path integral simulations with on-the-fly evaluation of the electronic structure at the hybrid density functional theory level to capture the interplay between nuclear quantum effects and the electronic surface. Here we show that this combination provides accurate structure and dynamics, including the full infrared and Raman spectra of liquid water. This allows us to demonstrate and explain the failings of lower-level density functionals for dynamics and vibrational spectroscopy when the nuclei are treated quantum mechanically. These insights thus provide a foundation for the reliable investigation of spectroscopy and reactivity in aqueous environments. }

  abstract = {Background: A number of methods are now available to perform automatic
	assignment of periodic secondary structures from atomic coordinates,
	based on different characteristics of the secondary structures. In
	general these methods exhibit a broad consensus as to the location
	of most helix and strand core segments in protein structures. However
	the termini of the segments are often ill-defined and it is difficult
	to decide unambiguously which residues at the edge of the segments
	have to be included. In addition, there is a "twilight zone" where
	secondary structure segments depart significantly from the idealized
	models of Pauling and Corey. For these segments, one has to decide
	whether the observed structural variations are merely distorsions
	or whether they constitute a break in the secondary structure. Methods:
	To address these problems, we have developed a method for secondary
	structure assignment, called KAKSI. Assignments made by KAKSI are
	compared with assignments given by DSSP, STRIDE, XTLSSTR, PSEA and
	SECSTR, as well as secondary structures found in PDB files, on 4
	datasets (X-ray structures with different resolution range, NMR structures).
	Results: A detailed comparison of KAKSI assignments with those of
	STRIDE and PSEA reveals that KAKSI assigns slightly longer helices
	and strands than STRIDE in case of one-to-one correspondence between
	the segments. However, KAKSI tends also to favor the assignment of
	several short helices when STRIDE and PSEA assign longer, kinked,
	helices. Helices assigned by KAKSI have geometrical characteristics
	close to those described in the PDB. They are more linear than helices
	assigned by other methods. The same tendency to split long segments
	is observed for strands, although less systematically. We present
	a number of cases of secondary structure assignments that illustrate
	this behavior. Conclusion: Our method provides valuable assignments
	which favor the regularity of secondary structure segments. 1471-2237}

	We also investigated the peroxidase activity of PfHRP2-FePPIX using

	polarization effects are to be expected at short separations. The
	monitored observable is the molecular dipole moment as a function

	Analytic formulas are derived for the components of the molecular

	Overall, the methods studied provide a remarkably good representation
	of the induced dipole, with no divergences appearing even at the
	shortest distances. For water close to a monovalent point charge
	the point dipole model, implemented with one or three dipoles, accurately
	reproduces the water dipole moment at all distances. Deficiencies
	appear as the molecular polarizability and/or charge increase: basically,
	the ab initio induced moments grow faster at intermediate distances

	methods, suggesting that nonlinear effects (hyperpolarizability)
	cannot be neglected in these cases. Regarding the capabilities of
	each method, the point dipole method is the one that performs best

	field, used in conjunction with any polarization scheme, allows to
	satisfactorily reproduce the dimer dipole at short distances. In
	contrast with the original approach (developed for intramolecular
	interactions), the present reparametrization is ion and method dependent,

	electrostatics evaluation to a continuum description at the maximal
	distance that is consistent with the minimum image convention, and,
	thus, avoids the use of a periodic electrostatic potential. A physically
	motivated switching function enables charge clusters interacting
	with a given charge to smoothly move into the solvent continuum by
	passing through the spherical dielectric boundary surrounding this
	charge. This transition is complete as soon as the cluster has reached
	the so-called truncation radius R-c. The algorithm is used to examine
	the dependence of thermodynamic properties and correlation functions
	on R-c in the three point transferable intermolecular potential water
	model. Our test simulations on pure liquid water used either the
	RF correction or a straight cutoff and values of R-c ranging from
	14 Angstrom to 40 Angstrom. In the RF setting, the thermodynamic
	properties and the correlation functions show convergence for R-c
	increasing towards 40 Angstrom. In the straight cutoff case no such
	convergence is found. Here, in particular, the dipole-dipole correlation

	expansion of the molecular pair distribution function into a set

	analytical expressions in the particular case in which liquid water
	is conceived as a dielectric continuum. Comparisons of these continuum
	models with the correlation functions derived from the simulations
	yield the key result that liquid water behaves like a continuum dielectric
	beyond distances of about 15 {{\AA}} from a given water molecule.

	based on simple hybridization considerations rather than individual
	force constants and geometric parameters that depend on the particular
	combination of atoms involved in the bond, angle, or torsion terms.
	Thus all bond distances are derived from atomic radii, and there
	is only one force constant each for bonds, angles, and inversions
	and only six different values for torsional barriers. Parameters
	are defined for all possible combinations of atoms and new atoms
	can be added to the force field rather simply. This paper reports
	the parameters for the ''nonmetallic'' main-group elements (B, C,
	N, O, F columns for the C, Si, Ge, and Sn rows) plus H and a few
	metals (Na, Ca, Zn, Fe). The accuracy of the DREIDING force field
	is tested by comparing with (i) 76 accurately determined crystal
	structures of organic compounds involving H, C, N, O, F, P, S, Cl,
	and Br, (ii) rotational barriers of a number of molecules, and (iii)

	raises the puzzling possibility, irrespective of conformational entropy,
	that individual microscopic folding trajectories may encounter large
	uphill moves and thus the multidimensional freeenergy landscape may
	not be funnel-like. Here, we investigate how nanoscale hydrophobic
	interactions might underpin this salient enthalpic effect in biomolecular
	assembly by computer simulations of the association of two preformed
	polyalanine or polyleucine helices in water. We observe a high, positive
	enthalpic signature at room temperature when the helix separation
	is less than a single layer of water molecules. Remarkably, this
	unfavorable enthalpy change, with a parallel increase in void volume,
	is largely compensated for by a concomitant increase in solvent entropy,
	netting only a small or nonexistent microscopic free-energy barrier.
	Thus, our findings suggest that high enthalpic folding barriers can
	be consistent with a funnel picture of folding and are mainly a desolvation
	phenomenon indicative of a cooperative mechanism of simultaneous
	formation of multiple side-chain contacts at the rate-limiting step.}

	It has been noted that some metabolites of pyrethroids, in particular,
	permethrin and cypermethrin, have chemical structures that are more
	likely to interact with the cellular estrogen receptor than the parent
	pyrethroid. For this study permethrin and cypermethrin metabolites
	3-(4-hydroxy-3-phenoxy)benzyl alcohol, 3-(4-hydroxy-3-phenoxy)benzoic
	acid, and N-3-(phenoxybenzoyl)glycine were synthesised, and together

  abstract = {For the characterization of protein sequences and post-translational
	modifications by MS, the `top-down' proteomics approach utilizes
	molecular and fragment ion mass data obtained by ionizing and dissociating
	a protein in the mass spectrometer. This requires more complex instrumentation
	and methodology than the far more widely used `bottom-up' approach,
	which instead uses such data of peptides from the protein's digestion,
	but the top-down data are far more specific. The ESI MS spectrum
	of a 14 protein mixture provides full separation of its molecular
	ions for MS/MS dissociation of the individual components. False-positive
	rates for the identification of proteins are far lower with the top-down
	approach, and quantitation of multiply modified isomers is more efficient.
	Bottom-up proteolysis destroys the information on the size of the
	protein and the connectivities of the peptide fragments, but it has
	no size limit for protein digestion. In contrast, the top-down approach
	has a similar to 500 residue, similar to 50 kDa limitation for the
	extensive molecular ion dissociation required. Basic studies indicate
	that this molecular ion intractability arises from greatly strengthened
	electrostatic interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, in the gas-phase
	molecular ions. This limit is now greatly extended by variable thermal
	and collisional activation just after electrospray ('prefolding dissociation').
	This process can cleave 287 inter-residue bonds in the termini of
	a 1314 residue (144 kDa) protein, specify previously unidentified
	disulfide bonds between eight of 27 cysteines in a 1714 residue (200
	kDa) protein, and correct sequence predictions in two proteins, one
	of 2153 residues (229 kDa).},

The conventional metric of success for new functionals has been the accuracy of their calculated energies. Medvedev et al. examined how well these functionals calculate electron density across a series of neutral and cationic atoms (see the Perspective by Hammes-Schiffer). Although historically the accuracies of energy and density have improved in tandem, certain recent functionals have sacrificed fidelity to the true density.Science, this issue p. 49; see also p. 28The theorems at the core of density functional theory (DFT) state that the energy of a many-electron system in its ground state is fully defined by its electron density distribution. This connection is made via the exact functional for the energy, which minimizes at the exact density. For years, DFT development focused on energies, implicitly assuming that functionals producing better energies become better approximations of the exact functional. We examined the other side of the coin: the energy-minimizing electron densities for atomic species, as produced by 128 historical and modern DFT functionals. We found that these densities became closer to the exact ones, reflecting theoretical advances, until the early 2000s, when this trend was reversed by unconstrained functionals sacrificing physical rigor for the flexibility of empirical fitting.},

abstract = { In order to carry out a detailed analysis of the molecular static polarizability, which is the response of the molecule to a uniform external electric field, the molecular polarizability was computed using the finite-difference method for 21 small molecules, using density functional theory. Within nine charge population schemes (L\"{o}wdin, Mulliken, Becke, Hirshfeld, CM5, Hirshfeld-I, NPA, CHELPG, MK-ESP) in common use, the charge fluctuation contribution is found to dominate the molecular polarizability, with its ratio ranging from 59.9\% with the Hirshfeld or CM5 scheme to 96.2\% with the Mulliken scheme. The Hirshfeld-I scheme is also used to compute the other contribution to the molecular polarizability coming from the induced atomic dipoles, and the atomic polarizabilities in eight small molecules and water pentamer are found to be highly anisotropic for most atoms. Overall, the results suggest that (a) more emphasis probably should be placed on the charge fluctuation terms in future polarizable force field development and (b) an anisotropic polarizability might be more suitable than an isotropic one in polarizable force fields based entirely or partially on the induced atomic dipoles. }

	preedge resonances at 401.3 and 402.6 eV observed in the spectrum
	of anionic glycine indicate that the nitrogen terminus is in an ``acceptor-only{''}
	configuration, wherein neither amine proton is involved in hydrogen
	bonding to the solvent, at high pH. The analogous 1s -> sigma{*}(NH)
	preedge transitions are absent in the NEXAFS spectrum of anionic
	proline, implying that the acceptor-only conformation observed in
	anionic glycine arises from steric shielding induced by free rotation
	of the amine terminus about the glycine CN bond. Anionic diglycine
	solutions exhibit a broadened Is -> pi{*}(CN) resonance at 401.2
	eV and a broad shoulder resonance at 403 eV, also suggesting the
	presence of an acceptor-only species. Although this assignment is
	not as unambiguous as for glycine, it implies that the nitrogen terminus
	of most proteins is capable of existing in an acceptor-only conformation
	at high pH. The NEXAFS spectrum of zwitterionic lysine solution was
	also measured, exhibiting features similar to those of both anionic
	and zwitterionic glycine, and leading us to conclude that the a amine
	group is present in an acceptor-only configuration, while the end
	of the butylammonium side chain is fully solvated.},

  abstract = {An all-atom theory of viral structural transitions (STs) is developed
	based on a multiscale analysis of the N-atom Liouville equation.
	The approach yields an understanding of viral STs from first principles
	and a calibrated interatomic force field. To carry out the multiscale
	analysis, we introduce slow variables characterizing the whole-virus
	dynamics. Use of the ``nanocanonical ensemble'' technique and the
	fundamental hypothesis of statistical mechanics (i.e., the equivalence
	of long-time and ensemble averages) is shown to imply a Fokker-Planck
	equation yielding the coarse-grained evolution of the slow variables.
	As viral STs occur on long time scales, transition state theory is
	used to estimate the energy barrier of transition between free energy
	wells implied by observed hysteresis in viral STs. Its application
	to Nudaurelia capensis omega virus provides an upper bound on the
	free energy barrier when a single dilatational order parameter is
	used. The long time scale of viral STs is shown to follow from the
	aggregate effect of inertia, energy barrier, and entropic effects.
	Our formulation can be generalized for multiple order parameter models
	to account for lower free energy barrier pathways for transition.
	The theory with its all-atom description can be applied to nonviral

  abstract = {This paper describes a model for analyzing and predicting the temporal
	behavior of laser-induced incandescence (LII) from combustion-generated
	soot, carbon black, and other carbonaceous particles on a nanosecond
	time scale. The model accounts for particle heating by absorption
	of light from a pulsed laser and cooling by sublimation, conduction,
	and radiation. The model also includes mechanisms for oxidation,
	melting, and annealing of the particles and nonthermal photodesorption
	of carbon clusters from the particle surface. At fluences above 0.1
	J/cm(2), particle temperatures during the laser pulse are determined
	by the balance between absorption and sublimation, whereas at lower
	fluences particle temperatures do not reach the sublimation temperature,
	and temperatures are predominantly controlled by absorption and conduction.
	After the laser pulse, temperatures are predominantly controlled
	by conductive cooling rates. Oxidative heating may compete with conductive
	cooling on these time scales. Annealing of the particles to a more
	ordered phase of carbon is predicted to occur at fluences as low
	as 0.02 J/cm(2). Annealing may strongly influence sublimation rates,
	and changes in emissivity during annealing are predicted to increase
	signal decay rates. Supersonic expansion of the carbon clusters sublimed
	from the surface is calculated to occur at fluences above 0.12 J/cm(2).
	When compared with LII measurements recorded in a flame at atmospheric
	pressure, the model reproduces the shapes and relative magnitudes
	of LII temporal profiles over a wide range of laser fluences. Comparisons
	between model predictions and experimental observations suggest that
	the particles do not melt at laser fluences that lead to melting
	of bulk graphite. These comparisons also indicate that the energy
	released during particle annealing is much smaller than that released
	during annealing of neutron- or electron-irradiated graphite. Despite
	good agreement between model and experimental results, large uncertainties
	exist for input parameters used to calculate annealing rates and
	rates of oxidation, conduction, absorption, emission, and photolytic
	desorption of carbon clusters for both the initial and annealed particles.

	in the conformational examination of peptides and related molecules
	by molecular dynamics are illustrated. The first is the explicit
	use of organic solvents in the simulations. For many cases such solvents
	are appropriate since the nmr measurements (or other experimental
	observations) were carried out in the same solvent. Here, the use
	of dimethylsulfoxide and chloroform in molecular dynamics is described,
	with some advantages of the use of these solvents high-lighted. A
	constant allowing for the scaling of the nonbonded interactions of
	the force field, an idea previously employed in distance geometry
	and simulated annealing, has been implemented. The usefulness of
	this method is that when the nonbonded term is turned to zero, atoms
	can pass through each other, while the connectivity of the molecule
	is maintained. It will be shown that such simulations, if a sufficient
	driving force is present (i.e., nuclear Overhauser effects restraints),
	can produce the correct stereoconfiguration (i.e., chiral center)
	as well as configurational isomer (i.e., cis/trans isomers). Lastly,
	a penalty term for coupling constants directly related to the Karplus
	curve has been implemented into the potential energy force field.
	The advantages of this method over the commonly used dihedral angle
	restraining are discussed. In particular, it is shown that with more
	than one coupling constant about a dihedral angle a great reduction
	of the allowed conformational space is obtained.}

	energy simulation, which permits efficient calculation of the free

	to obtain efficient canonical sampling for rapid free energy convergence.
	The proposal is motivated by the insight that both the exchange efficiency
	in the presently designed dual-topology alchemical Hamiltonian replica
	exchange method (HREM), and the confidence of the free energy determination
	using the overlap histogramming method, depend on the same criterion,
	viz., the overlaps of the energy difference histograms between all
	pairs of neighboring states. Hence, integrating these two techniques
	can produce a joint solution to the problems of the free energy convergence
	and conformational sampling in the free energy simulations, in which
	lambda parameter plays two roles to simultaneously facilitate the
	conformational sampling and improve the phase space overlap for the
	free energy determination. Specifically, in contrast with other alchemical
	HREM based free energy simulation methods, the dual-topology approach
	can ensure robust conformational sampling. Due to these features
	(a synergistic solution to the free energy convergence and canonical
	sampling, and the improvement of the sampling efficiency with the
	dual-topology treatment), the present approach, as demonstrated in
	the model studies of the authors, is highly efficient in obtaining

	being applied to studies of protein folding, Recent developments
	in soft ionization techniques enable intact proteins to be generated

	are providing a means of obtaining sequence-specific information.
	These techniques, particularly in combination with established methods
	such as NMR spectroscopy, allow the investigation of both covalent
	and noncovalent events that occur during refolding processes, One
	important type of application involves mass spectrometry in an analytical
	role, for example, in characterizing the products of oxidative refolding
	experiments, Mass spectrometry can also be used to reveal fundamentally
	new information about the conformational properties of folding intermediates,
	both in isolation and in complexes with molecular chaperones, through
	the exploitation of hydrogen-deuterium exchange phenomena. Of particular
	interest is the insight this approach can provide into the cooperativity
	of structure formation and the distribution of intermediates at different
	steps along folding pathways. In this paper we describe recent insights

It uses a new quasi-Hermitian method of constructing the optimal approximate polynomial for the tabularly defined potential curve of a diatomic molecule obtained from an ab initio calculation. In this method the optimal polynomial approximates the potential curve and its derivatives, but it uses only information about the potential curve for its construction. This property of the new method arises from analysis of a spectral representation of the optimal polynomial to determine how well it approximates the potential curve and its derivatives. Appropriate derivatives of the potential curve, needed in the Dunham method, are calculated by recurrence relations. Comparison with the finite-difference method shows that the precision of both methods is similar, while the Dunham method is hundreds of times faster. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Comput Chem 19: 94-101, 1998},

abstract = { Traditional approaches to specifying a molecular mechanics force field encode all the information needed to assign force field parameters to a given molecule into a discrete set of atom types. This is equivalent to a representation consisting of a molecular graph comprising a set of vertices, which represent atoms labeled by atom type, and unlabeled edges, which represent chemical bonds. Bond stretch, angle bend, and dihedral parameters are then assigned by looking up bonded pairs, triplets, and quartets of atom types in parameter tables to assign valence terms and using the atom types themselves to assign nonbonded parameters. This approach, which we call indirect chemical perception because it operates on the intermediate graph of atom-typed nodes, creates a number of technical problems. For example, atom types must be sufficiently complex to encode all necessary information about the molecular environment, making it difficult to extend force fields encoded this way. Atom typing also results in a proliferation of redundant parameters applied to chemically equivalent classes of valence terms, needlessly increasing force field complexity. Here, we describe a new approach to assigning force field parameters via direct chemical perception. Rather than working through the intermediary of the atom-typed graph, direct chemical perception operates directly on the unmodified chemical graph of the molecule to assign parameters. In particular, parameters are assigned to each type of force field term (e.g., bond stretch, angle bend, torsion, and Lennard–Jones) based on standard chemical substructure queries implemented via the industry-standard SMARTS chemical perception language, using SMIRKS extensions that permit labeling of specific atoms within a chemical pattern. We use this to implement a new force field format, called the SMIRKS Native Open Force Field (SMIRNOFF) format. We demonstrate the power and generality of this approach using examples of specific molecules that pose problems for indirect chemical perception and construct and validate a minimalist yet very general force field, SMIRNOFF99Frosst. We find that a parameter definition file only ∼300 lines long provides coverage of all but <0.02\% of a 5 million molecule drug-like test set. Despite its simplicity, the accuracy of SMIRNOFF99Frosst for small molecule hydration free energies and selected properties of pure organic liquids is similar to that of the General Amber Force Field, whose specification requires thousands of parameters. This force field provides a starting point for further optimization and refitting work to follow. }

The procedure is based on the study of the linear response of the maximally localized Wannier functions to an applied external field, within density functional theory. For most monoatomic cations (Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Mg2+, Ca2+ and Sr2+) the computed polarizabilities are the same as in the gas phase.  For Cs+ and a series of anions (F-, Cl-, Br- and I-), environmental effects are observed, which reduce the polarizabilities in aqueous solutions with respect to their gas phase values. The polarizabilities of H+(aq), OH(aq) have also been determined along an ab initio molecular dynamics simulation. We observe that the polarizability of a molecule instantaneously switches upon proton transfer events.  Finally, we also computed the polarizability tensor in the case of a strongly anisotropic molecular ion, UO2+. The results of these calculations will be useful in building interaction potentials that include 
polarization effects.}

  abstract = {A new force field has been designed to implement the calculation of
	Coulomb interactions with fluctuating atomic charges. The charges
	are calculated by use of a semi-empirical quantum chemical method
	bond polarization theory (BPT). The BPT method establishes a direct
	proportionality between molecular properties, for instance atomic
	charges or chemical shifts, and bond polarization energies. These
	energies are calculated from bond orbitals that are constructed for
	every bond of the force field. Thus the charges depend on the three-dimensional
	geometry of the molecular system, and it is possible to include all
	mutual polarizations in the term for electrostatic interaction. The
	primary goal of this new force field is better description of the
	intermolecular interactions of molecular systems. No special term
	within the force field is applied for the description of hydrogen
	bonds. The inclusion of the polarization effect over the whole system
	is one of the most important advantages of the method in respect
	of force fields that divide the molecular system into molecular mechanics
	and quantum chemical regions. The force field was tested by being
	used to describe the structure and interaction energies of several
	small molecular systems (26 hydrogen-bonded dimers) from a web-based
	ab initio data collection by Halgren. The results show an overall
	RMS deviation of 2.5 kcal mol(-1) for the interaction energies, 0.06
	Angstrom for the hydrogen bond distances (X...Z) and 20.1 degrees
	for the X-H...Z angles. This is comparable with most existing force
	fields. The results were obtained with the original parametrization
	of Halgren for the van der Waals interactions without any fine tuning
	of the interaction parameters. Additional interaction energies and
	structures of selected DNA/RNA base pairs (see Figure) were studied.
	The geometries of hydrogen bonds, in particular, are reproduced satisfactorily
	- after geometry optimization the distances differ on average by
	0.06 Angstrom and in the angles by 6 degrees from the ab initio Hartree-Fock
	results including correlation. 0948-5023}

  abstract = {Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale that
	is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena
	include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological
	materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer
	simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2-3 orders
	of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing
	a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed
	a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force
	field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer
	systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential
	of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from
	the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer.
	We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning
	of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation,of
	WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine
	and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison
	with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement
	in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation
	of the partitioning of five series of polyalanine-leucine peptides
	(with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected,
	the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with
	decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating
	that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior
	arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally,
	we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane
	pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic
	simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion,
	the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces
	peptide-lipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and
	peptides in lipid bilayers.},

Here, we obtain the Raman spectra of water from its melting to boiling point, both experimentally and from simulations using an ab initio-trained machine learning potential. We use these to assign the Raman bands and show that the entire spectrum can be well described as a combination of two temperature-independent spectra. We then assess which spectral regions exhibit strong dependence on the local tetrahedral order in the liquid. Further, this work demonstrates that changes in this structural parameter can be used to elucidate the temperature dependence of the Raman spectrum of liquid water and provides a guide to the Raman features that signal water ordering in more complex aqueous systems. }

Because of these thermodynamic conditions, a specific simulation algorithm has been developed to bypass common simulation problems resulting from very low densities of steam and cluster formation therein. In addition to pressure-temperature-density and orthobaric data, the distribution of clusters has also been evaluated. The obtained extensive data of high precision should serve as a basis for development of reliable molecular-based equations for properties of metastable steam.}

	(FTIR) spectroscopy at I atm and 22 +/- 1 degrees C. The SAMs included
	C18 and C8 alkanes, as well as the C8 terminal alkene: Oxidation
	of the terminal alkene SAM was carried out with either KMnO4 solution
	or gaseous O-3. The FTIR data showed at least two distinct peaks
	due to water on these surfaces, one at similar to 3200 cm(-1), which
	dominates at low RH (20\%), and one at similar to 3400 cm(-1) at

	with water vapor on the oxidized alkene was not significantly different
	from that on the unoxidized SAM, although there was a change in the

	on the surface of small water clusters that dominate on SAM surfaces
	at low RH have fewer hydrogen bonds, while those in the interior

	liquid water. Taken together, the experimental infrared data and

	of the 3200 cm(-1)/3400 cm(-1) bands and the hydrogen-bonding patterns
	of the water on the surface and in the interior of clusters on the
	SAM surfaces. These studies suggest that water clusters will be present
	even on hydrophobic surfaces in the atmosphere and hence are available
	to participate in heterogeneous chemistry. In addition, oxidation
	of organic coatings on atmospheric particles or surfaces in the boundary

	interface. Therefore, both cations and anions exhibit enhanced concentrations
	at the surface and, consequently, these acids (unlike bases and salts)
	reduce the surface tension of water. The results of the simulations

  abstract = {Insect flight requires rapid mobilization of energy reserves during
	flight, which is mediated and regulated by hormonal control via adipokinetic
	hormones. The structure of the G-protein receptors to which these
	hormones bind, are crucial in understanding many of the physiological
	processes in which they play a central role. To date no 3D structure
	of an insect G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) is available. Here,
	the first models of the 3D structures of a GPCR from the malaria
	mosquito are presented. Homology modeling of the receptor identified
	from the genome of Anopheles gambiae was used to construct two models
	of the receptor. The 7 transmembrane helical bundles of these two
	models are based on the crystal structures of beta2-adrenergic receptor
	and rhodopsin. The flexible loop regions were modeled using high
	temperature simulated annealing and constrained molecular dynamic
	simulations. The two receptor models differ in a number of critical
	features, the most important of which is that the rhodopsin-based
	model has a `closed' structure while the beta2-based structure is
	`open'. The `open' conformation provides easy access of the hormone
	to the binding pocket. Docking calculations with the insect adipokinetic
	hormones, AKH-1 (pGlu-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Ala-Trp-NH2) from the malaria
	mosquito and Del-CC (pGlu-Lys-Asn-Phe-Ser-Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-Asn-NH2)
	from the blister beetle showed that while the binding motif of the
	two is similar. AKH-1 has more than 30 times higher affinity than
	Del-CC, which strongly suggests that the binding is specific, and
	that the correct binding site was identified. Using these models
	it is possible to design antagonists, which block the binding site
	and are thus species-specific insecticides. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

	We previously proposed that these bundles may serve as conduits for
	RNA membrane translocation. Additional support for this hypothesis
	is now provided by the first atomic resolution structure of a T =
	4 RNA virus, where we find cleavage sites and helical bundles nearly
	identical with those observed in T = 3 nodaviruses. The helices are

	by 240 copies of a single subunit type. The subunit is composed of
	a helical inner domain (where the cleavage occurs) containing residues
	preceding and following a canonical, viral, eight-stranded beta-sandwich
	that forms the contiguous shell. Inserted between two strands of

	The high in-cloud humidity may be related to the low number of ice
	crystals found in these clouds(4,6), but low ice number densities
	are inconsistent with standard models of cirrus cloud formation involving
	homogeneous freezing of liquid aerosols(7). Aqueous aerosols rich

	showed ice nuclei rich in oxidized organic matter(12), consistent

	OPTabstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is now routinely used for simulating material properties. Many software packages are available, which makes it challenging to know which are the best to use for a specific calculation. Lejaeghere et al. compared the calculated values for the equation of states for 71 elemental crystals from 15 different widely used DFT codes employing 40 different potentials (see the Perspective by Skylaris). Although there were variations in the calculated values, most recent codes and methods converged toward a single value, with errors comparable to those of experiment.Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad3000; see also p. 1394INTRODUCTIONThe reproducibility of results is one of the underlying principles of science. An observation can only be accepted by the scientific community when it can be confirmed by independent studies. However, reproducibility does not come easily. Recent works have painfully exposed cases where previous conclusions were not upheld. The scrutiny of the scientific community has also turned to research involving computer programs, finding that reproducibility depends more strongly on implementation than commonly thought. These problems are especially relevant for property predictions of crystals and molecules, which hinge on precise computer implementations of the governing equation of quantum physics.RATIONALEThis work focuses on density functional theory (DFT), a particularly popular quantum method for both academic and industrial applications. More than 15,000 DFT papers are published each year, and DFT is now increasingly used in an automated fashion to build large databases or apply multiscale techniques with limited human supervision. Therefore, the reproducibility of DFT results underlies the scientific credibility of a substantial fraction of current work in the natural and engineering sciences. A plethora of DFT computer codes are available, many of them differing considerably in their details of implementation, and each yielding a certain {\textquotedblleft}precision{\textquotedblright} relative to other codes. How is one to decide for more than a few simple cases which code predicts the correct result, and which does not? We devised a procedure to assess the precision of DFT methods and used this to demonstrate reproducibility among many of the most widely used DFT codes. The essential part of this assessment is a pairwise comparison of a wide range of methods with respect to their predictions of the equations of state of the elemental crystals. This effort required the combined expertise of a large group of code developers and expert users.RESULTSWe calculated equation-of-state data for four classes of DFT implementations, totaling 40 methods. Most codes agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Even in the case of pseudization approaches, which largely depend on the atomic potentials used, a similar precision can be obtained as when using the full potential. The remaining deviations are due to subtle effects, such as specific numerical implementations or the treatment of relativistic terms.CONCLUSIONOur work demonstrates that the precision of DFT implementations can be determined, even in the absence of one absolute reference code. Although this was not the case 5 to 10 years ago, most of the commonly used codes and methods are now found to predict essentially identical results. The established precision of DFT codes not only ensures the reproducibility of DFT predictions but also puts several past and future developments on a firmer footing. Any newly developed methodology can now be tested against the benchmark to verify whether it reaches the same level of precision. New DFT applications can be shown to have used a sufficiently precise method. Moreover, high-precision DFT calculations are essential for developing improvements to DFT methodology, such as new density functionals, which may further increase the predictive power of the simulations.Recent DFT methods yield reproducible results.Whereas older DFT implementations predict different values (red darts), codes have now evolved to mutual agreement (green darts). The scoreboard illustrates the good pairwise agreement of four classes of DFT implementations (horizontal direction) with all-electron results (vertical direction). Each number reflects the average difference between the equations of state for a given pair of methods, with the green-to-red color scheme showing the range from the best to the poorest agreement.The widespread popularity of density functional theory has given rise to an extensive range of dedicated codes for predicting molecular and crystalline properties. However, each code implements the formalism in a different way, raising questions about the reproducibility of such predictions. We report the results of a community-wide effort that compared 15 solid-state codes, using 40 different potentials or basis set types, to assess the quality of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof equations of state for 71 elemental crystals. We conclude that predictions from recent codes and pseudopotentials agree very well, with pairwise differences that are comparable to those between different high-precision experiments. Older methods, however, have less precise agreement. Our benchmark provides a framework for users and developers to document the precision of new applications and methodological improvements.},

  abstract = {Polarized one-electron potential (POP) optimization is a powerful
	and practical method to determine multicenter dipole polarizabilities
	that can be used for constructing polarizable force fields. The POP
	optimization is similar to the widely used electrostatic potential
	(ESP) optimization to determine the partial charges of molecules.
	However, while the ESP optimization targets the electrostatic potentials
	on a molecular surface, the POP optimization targets the change of
	electrostatic potentials on molecular surfaces which are induced
	by the field of a test charge on the molecular surface. Since only
	additional one-electron integrals for the test charge are required
	for the estimation of the surface potentials, the change of electrostatic
	potentials has been named ``polarized one-electron potentials''.
	We show that in the POP optimization, both an explicitly interacting
	polarizability model and an implicitly interacting polarizability
	model can be used for the determination of the multicenter polarizabilities.
	In the explicitly interacting model, intramolecular induced dipole-induced
	dipole interaction is mutually included in the process of the POP
	optimization, but the interaction is not included in the implicitly
	interacting model. In the implicitly interacting polarizability model,
	a combined model of isotropic atom polarization and anisotropic bond
	polarization is shown to provide the best fitting results for nucleic
	acid bases which show large polarization anisotropy. A simple scaling
	model to the chemical bond has been newly proposed for the explicitly
	interacting polarizability model. We show that the simple model can
	be applied to molecular simulations without any damping of exponential
	type in the intramolecular induced dipole interaction. A detailed

	by the POP optimization is also presented.},

	the increase in the number of hydration water molecules was prominent

We have developed a large-scale quantum chemistry database based on first-principles methods. Our database currently contains the ground-state electronic structures of 3 million molecules based on density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level, and we successively calculated 10 low-lying excited states of over 2 million molecules via time-dependent DFT with the B3LYP functional and the 6-31+G* basis set. To select the molecules calculated in our project, we referred to the PubChem Project, which was used as the source of the molecular structures in short strings using the InChI and SMILES representations. Accordingly, we have named our quantum chemistry database project “PubChemQC” (http://pubchemqc.riken.jp/) and placed it in the public domain. In this paper, we show the fundamental features of the PubChemQC database and discuss the techniques used to construct the data set for large-scale quantum chemistry calculations. We also present a machine learning approach to predict the electronic structure of molecules as an example to demonstrate the suitability of the large-scale quantum chemistry database. }

Furthermore, the PECs are recomputed by the CCSD(T) level of theory (with all electrons correlated) with the aug-cc-pCVQZ, cc-pV5Z, cc-pCV5Z, cc-pV6Z and 6ZaPa-NR basis sets. In addition, the correlation energy, the dissociation energy (De), the ionization potential (IP) and spectroscopic constants have also been computed by the obtained PECs. The Hartree-Fock (HF) energy has been computed by the aforementioned basis sets for all of the studied species. All of the obtained HF energies in this work are more negative than the previous computations, except for the Be atom."

In addition to the molecular moieties, Li+, Li−, H− ions have also been studied by the aforementioned methods. The employed trial wave functions for the DMC calculations are a multiplication of multi-configuration expansions which are prepared by the Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field method (CASSCF) with the aug-cc-pVTZ and the aug-cc-pCVTZ basis sets and the Jastrow factor. The CCSD(T) computations with all electrons correlated, have been performed by the cc-pV5Z, aug-cc-pCVQZ and aug-cc-pV6Z basis sets. In addition, the correlation energies for all of the studied atomic and molecular species have been calculated. For the studied molecular species, the Hartree-Fock energies in the complete basis set limit (ECBS) have not been reported. In this work for each of the molecular systems, the most negative energy which has been computed by the cc-pV5Z or aug-cc-pCVQZ basis sets has been used. The obtained PECs by the DMC and CCSD(T) methods are used to calculate the vibration-rotation energy levels and spectroscopic constants."

	energy landscape as a function of several types of reaction coordinates,
	four local minima corresponding to the folded, partially folded,

	collapse of hydrophobic core -> formation of H-bond -> formation
	of the turn. Identifying the folded and molten globule states as
	the main conformations, the free energy landscape of the beta-hairpin
	is consistent with a two-state behavior with a broad transition state.
	The temperature dependence of the folding-unfolding transition is
	investigated in some detail. The enthalpy and entropy jumps at the
	folding transition temperature are found to be about three times

The continued increase in computer power accompanied by advances in correlated electronic structure methods nowadays enables routine calculations of accurate interaction energies for small systems, which can then be used as references for the development of analytical potential energy functions (PEFs) rigorously derived from many-body (MB) expansions. Building on the accuracy of the MB-pol many-body PEF, we investigate here the performance of permutationally invariant polynomials (PIPs), neural networks, and Gaussian approximation potentials (GAPs) in representing water two-body and three-body interaction energies, denoting the resulting potentials PIP-MB-pol, Behler-Parrinello neural network-MB-pol, and GAP-MB-pol, respectively. Our analysis shows that all three analytical representations exhibit similar levels of accuracy in reproducing both two-body and three-body reference data as well as interaction energies of small water clusters obtained from calculations carried out at the coupled cluster level of theory, the current gold standard for chemical accuracy. These results demonstrate the synergy between interatomic potentials formulated in terms of a many-body expansion, such as MB-pol, that are physically sound and transferable, and machine-learning techniques that provide a flexible framework to approximate the short-range interaction energy terms.}

	plane together with the lipids surrounding them. We find a number
	of intriguing phenomena. The lateral displacements of the protein
	and the lipids are strongly correlated, as the protein and the neighboring
	lipids form a dynamical protein-lipid complex, consisting of similar
	to 50-100 lipids. The diffusion of the lipids in the complex is much
	slower compared to the rest of the lipids. We also find a strong
	directional correlation between the movements of the protein and
	the lipids in its vicinity. The results imply that in crowded membrane
	environments there are no ``free{''} lipids, as they are all influenced
	by the protein structure and dynamics. Our results indicate that,
	in studies of cell membranes, protein and lipid dynamics have to
	be considered together.},

When hot it is a normal simple liquid; however, close to ambient temperatures properties, such as the compressibility, begin to deviate and do so increasingly on further cooling. Clearly, these emerging properties are connected to its ability to form up to four well-defined hydrogen bonds allowing for different local structural arrangements. A wealth of new data from various experiments and simulations has recently become available. When taken together they point to a heterogeneous picture with fluctuations between two classes of local structural environments developing on temperature-dependent length scales.}

  abstract = {Contrary to the expectations from classic theories of ion solvation,
	spectroscopy and computer simulations of the liquid-vapor interface
	of aqueous electrolyte solutions suggest that ions little larger
	than a water molecule can prefer to reside near the liquid's surface.
	Here we advance the view that such affinity originates in a competition
	between strong opposing forces, primarily due to volume exclusion
	and dielectric polarization, that are common to all dense polar liquids.
	We present evidence for this generic mechanism from computer simulations
	of (i) water and (ii) a Stockmayer fluid near its triple point. In
	both cases, we show that strong surface enhancement of small ions,
	obtained by tuning solutes' size and charge, can be accentuated or
	suppressed by modest changes in either of those parameters. Statistics
	of solvent polarization, when the ion is held at and above the Gibbs
	dividing surface, highlight a basic deficiency in conventional models
	of dielectric response, namely, the neglect of interfacial flexibility.
	By distorting the solution's boundary, an ion experiences fluctuations
	in electrostatic potential and in electric field whose magnitudes
	attenuate much more gradually (as the ion is removed from the liquid
	phase) than for a quiescent planar interface. As one consequence,
	the collective responses that determine free energies of solvation
	can resolve very differently in nonuniform environments than in bulk.
	We show that this persistence of electric-field fluctuations additionally
	shapes the sensitivity of solute distributions to ion polarizability.},

	a measure of drug susceptibility. It was the aim of the present study
	to develop a malaria drug sensitivity assay based on the measurement
	of HRP2 in a simple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The
	new test proved to be as reliable as traditional in vitro assays,
	while it was considerably easier to establish and perform. Parasites
	are incubated at an initial level of parasitemia of 0.01 to 0.1\%
	on microculture plates predosed with ascending concentrations of
	antimalarial drugs. After incubation for 48 to 72 h, the samples
	are freeze-thawed and transferred to ELISA plates. The complete ELISA
	takes about 2.5 h to perform, may be carried out with commercially,
	available test kits, and requires relatively little technical equipment.
	In correlation analysis, the results closely paralleled those obtained
	by the isotopic assay (R = 0.892; P < 0.0001) and World Health Organization
	schizont maturation tests (R = 0.959; P < 0.0001). The novel HRP2
	drug susceptibility assay proved to be very sensitive, simple to
	establish, and highly reproducible. It can be used for a wide range
	of applications, from epidemiological studies to the screening of
	new drugs, and may have the potential to replace traditional in vitro
	techniques. Standard operating procedures, updated information, and
	analytical software are available from http://malatin.firch.net.

	estimates of adsorbing water and analogues of amino acid side chains

	of structured water form on the surface, which is driven by the formation
	of a strong hydrogen bond network at the interface. Interestingly,
	we find that the free energy change to move methane (analogue of the
	side chain of alanine) from bulk water to the (10j 10) interface
	is favorable. We ascribe this to the presence of microscopic voids
	on the surface, which can accommodate small hydrophobic moieties

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Many computational chemistry analyses require the generation of conformers, either on-the-fly, or in advance. We present Confab, an open source command-line application for the systematic generation of low-energy conformers according to a diversity criterion.RESULTS:Confab generates conformations using the 'torsion driving approach' which involves iterating systematically through a set of allowed torsion angles for each rotatable bond. Energy is assessed using the MMFF94 forcefield. Diversity is measured using the heavy-atom root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) relative to conformers already stored. We investigated the recovery of crystal structures for a dataset of 1000 ligands from the Protein Data Bank with fewer than 1 million conformations. Confab can recover 97% of the molecules to within 1.5 A at a diversity level of 1.5 A and an energy cutoff of 50 kcal/mol.CONCLUSIONS:Confab is available from http://confab.googlecode.com webcite.},

	for different conformers. Although the charge equilibration (QEq)
	method was proposed by Rapp{\'{e}} and Goddard as a technique for
	easily calculating atomic charges that depend on the molecular conformation,
	this method utilizes the two-center Coulombic integrals of Slater
	type orbitals, which have unrealistic values for small interatomic
	distances. In this study, we instead calculated the atomic charges
	for 87 compounds using QEq methods in combination with five types
	of empirical equations to calculate the two-center Coulombic terms,
	and investigated which equation gives the most appropriate charges.
	As a result, it was found that the DasGupta--Huzinaga equation and
	the Ohno--Klopman equation are effective for the calculations of
	QEq charges and that the Ohno--Klopman equation with QEq/PD parameters
	derived by Bakowies and Thiel are best for calculating dipole moments.
	It was also discovered that both the quantitative and qualitative
	derivation of appropriate charges for compounds that contain formal
	charges or aromatic five-membered hetero-rings is not always possible
	using QEq methods.},

abstract = { The effects of charge overlap, or charge penetration, are neglected in most force fields and interaction terms in QM/MM methods. The effects are however significant at intermolecular distances near the van der Waals minimum. In the present study, we propose a method to evaluate the intermolecular Coloumb interaction using Slater-type functions, thus explicitly modeling the charge overlap. The computational cost of the method is low, which allows it to be used in large systems with most force fields as well as in QM/MM schemes. The charge distribution is modeled as a distributed multipole expansion up to quadrupole and Slater-type functions of angular momentum up to L = 1. The exponents of the Slater-type functions are obtained using a divide-and-conquer method to avoid the curse of dimensionality that otherwise is present for large nonlinear optimizations. A Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is applied in the fitting process. A set of parameters is obtained for each molecule, and the process is fully automated. Calculations have been performed in the carbon monoxide and the water dimers to illustrate the model. Results show a very good accuracy of the model with relative errors in the electrostatic potential lower than 3\% over all reasonable separations. At very short distances where the charge overlaps is the most significant, errors are lower than 8\% and lower than 3.5\% at distances near the van der Waals minimum. }

	cornerstone principles. We show that algebraically all known electronegativity
	equalization schemes can be divided into two different groups with
	respect to the underlying mathematical formalism and the degree to
	which electronegativity is equalized. Methods of the first group
	are based on the generalized hardness matrix formalism and provide
	complete electronegativity equalization, whereas another group of
	methods invokes the Laplacian matrix formalism and results in a redistribution
	of electronegativity rather than complete equalization. A new principle
	of electronegativity relaxation is introduced. Electronegativity
	identified with electrical potential is viewed as a harmonic function
	satisfying a discrete Laplace equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
	A Markov chain formalism for solving such equations is developed.
	Some numerical results of chemical interest are discussed. Application
	of atomic charges in different areas of molecular modeling is over-viewed.

	oscillator strength (df/dE) spectra which were originally normalized
	using valence shell TRK (i.e. S(O)) sum-rule normalization is presented
	for a series of dipole (e,e) measurements for 5 noble gases and 52
	small molecules. This comprehensive data set involves previously
	published absolute high resolution dipole (e,e) spectra of the valence
	shell discrete region combined with very wide range low resolution
	measurements in the ionization continuum for each atom or molecule.
	The absolute scales established for the dipole (e,e) spectra using
	the S(O) sum-rule in the originally published works (data available
	on the world wide web at ftp://chem.ubc.ca/pub/cooper or by anonymous
	ftp - see end of present paper for more details) are assessed by
	deriving static dipole polarizabilities for each atom and molecule
	using the S(-2) sum-rule. These values are found to be highly consistent
	with experimental and theoretical literature values of the static
	dipole polarizability and in almost all cases well within the estimated
	$\backslash$pm5\%\% accuracy of the originally published TRK sum-rule
	normalized absolute photoabsorption differential oscillator strength
	spectra. Significant errors of 8\%\% and 19\%\% in the previously
	published absolute oscillator strength scales for CCl4 (G.R. Burton,
	W.F. Chan, G. Cooper, C.E. Brion, Chem. Phys. 181 (1994) 147) and
	SiF4 (X. Guo, G. Cooper, W.F. Chan, G.R. Burton, C.E. Brion, Chem.
	Phys. 161 (1992) 453, 471) respectively are revealed by the dipole
	polarizability analysis and approproate corrections are recommended.
	Alternative methods of absolute scale determination for photoabsorption
	spectra using static or dynamic dipole polarizabilities from refractive
	index or dielectric constant measurements are also considered. These
	are found to be particularly useful especially where data are restricted
	to lower photon energies (< 60 eV) or where phenomena such as low
	lying inner shells, continuum shape resonances or Cooper minima preclude
	the use of the valence shell TRK sum-rule. As a result of the assessment
	of the absolute scales for the published dipole (e,e) spectra and
	since polarizabilities and refractive index data can typically be
	obtained with even higher precision (+-1\%\%), these data have been
	used to further refine the measured differential oscillator strength
	scales. On this basis, dipole oscillator strength sums S(u) (u =
	-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -10) and L(u) (u = -1, -2, -3, -4, -5,
	-6) are obtained from the df/dE spectra. For many of the systems
	considered, the presently reported dipole sums are derived molecular
	properties are more accurate than previously reported values. In
	fact, for 28 of the 52 small molecules these sum-rule values represent
	the only available values. The dipole sums can be used to calculate
	normal Verdet constants which are involved in the Faraday effect.
	It is also shown that accurate values of the rotationally averaged
	C6(A,B) dispersion coefficients for the long-range interaction of
	all possible pairs of atomic and/or molecular species can be obtained
	from the measured differential oscillator strength spectra. Alternatively,
	an approximation to C6(A,B), requiring only the S(-2) and L(-2) sums,
	is shown to provide very reliable estimates of C6(A,B).},

  abstract = {Modern simulation and modeling approaches to investigation of biomolecular structure and function rely heavily on a variety of methods—water models—to approximate the influence of solvent. We give a brief overview of several distinct classes of available water models, with the emphasis on the conceptual basis at each level of approximation. The main focus is on classes of models most widely used in atomistic simulations, including popular implicit and explicit solvent models. Among the latter, nonpolarizable N-point models are covered in most detail, including some recent methodological advances and nuances. Notes on practical availability and usage in biomolecular simulations are included. Atomistic simulations that were hardly possible only a short while ago have revealed significant problems that can be traced to deficiencies of most commonly used N-point water models. Recently developed models of this class approximate experimental properties of liquid water much closer than before, and show promise in practical biomolecular simulations. Obstacles to wider adoption of these more accurate water models, both technical and conceptual, are discussed. It is argued that verifying robustness of simulation results to the choice of water model can be of immediate benefit even in the absence of a clear replacement for older models; a specific strategy is proposed. The review is concluded with a discussion on how force-field development efforts can benefit from better solvent models, and vice versa.

From the simulation of liquids we have reported [M. Gonzalez-Melchor et al., J. Chem. Phys.122, 4503 (2005)] that the components of pressure tensor in parallelepiped boxes are not the same when periodic boundary conditions and small transversal areas are used. This fact creates an artificial oscillatory stress anisotropy in the system with even negative values. By OPTdoing direct simulations of interfaces we show in this work that surface tension has also an oscillatory decay at small surface areas; this behavior is opposite to the monotonic decay reported previously for the Lennard Jones fluid. It is shown that for small surface areas, the surface tension of the square-well potential artificially takes negative values and even increases with temperature. The calculated surface tension using a direct simulation of interfaces might have two contributions: one from finite-size effects of interfacial areas due to box geometry and another from the interface. Thus, it is difficult to evaluate the true surface tension of an interface when small surface areas are used. Care has to be taken to use the direct simulation method of interfaces to evaluate the predicted surface tension as a function of interfacial area from capillary-wave theory. The oscillations of surface tension decay faster at temperatures close to the critical point. It is also discussed that a surface area does not show any important effect on coexisting densities, making this method reliable to calculate bulk coexisting properties using small systems.}

	Predicting protein structures using atomically detailed physical

	folding mechanism would be whether it speeds up protein structure
	prediction in physical models. In the zipping and assembly (ZA) mechanism,
	local structuring happens first at independent sites along the chain,

	with other structures. Here, we apply the ZA search mechanism to
	protein native structure prediction by using the AMBER96 force field
	with a generalized Born/surface area implicit solvent model and sampling
	by replica exchange molecular dynamics. Starting from open denatured
	conformations, our algorithm, called the ZA method, converges to
	an average of 2.2 A from the Protein Data Bank native structures
	of eight of nine proteins that we tested, which ranged from 25 to
	73 aa in length. In addition, experimental Phi values, where available

  abstract = {The unique features of a macromolecule and water as a solvent make
	the issue of solvation unconventional, with questions about the static
	versus dynamic nature of hydration and the, physics of orientational
	and translational diffusion at the boundary. For proteins, the hydration
	shell that covers the surface is critical to the stability of its
	structure and function. Dynamically speaking, the residence time
	of water at the surface is a signature of its mobility and binding.
	With femtosecond time resolution it is possible to unravel the shortest
	residence times which are key for the description of the hydration
	layer, static or dynamic. In this article we review these issues
	guided by experimental studies, from this laboratory, of polar hydration
	dynamics at the surfaces of two proteins (Subtilisin Carlsberg (SC)
	and Monellin). The natural probe tryptophan amino acid was used for
	the interrogation of the dynamics, and for direct comparison we also
	studied the behavior in bulk water - a complete hydration in 1 ps.
	We develop a theoretical description of solvation and relate the
	theory to the experimental observations. In this - theoretical approach,
	we consider the dynamical equilibrium in the hydration shell, defining
	the rate processes for breaking and making the transient hydrogen
	bonds, and the effective friction in the layer which is defined by
	the translational and orientational motions of water molecules. The
	relationship between the residence time of water molecules and the
	observed slow component in solvation dynamics is a direct one. For
	the two proteins studied, we observed a ``bimodal decay'' for the
	hydration correlation function, with two primary relaxation times:
	ultrafast, typically 1 ps or less, and longer, typically 15-40 ps,
	and both are related to the residence time at the protein surface,
	depending on the binding energies. We end by making extensions to
	studies of the denatured state of the protein, random coils, and
	the biomimetic micelles, and conclude with our thoughts on the relevance
	of the dynamics of native structures to their functions. 1520-6106}

	An alkane crystal has been taken as the parent model for a hydrophobic
	surface. A hexagonal hole was created on it, which was half a nm
	deep and 2.5 nm wide. The density distributions of different species
	(water, anions, and cations) are studied as a function of distance
	from the surface. While iodide prefers the interface, the fluoride
	ions stay inside the bulk water region. The higher concentration
	of iodide ions at the interface drags sodium counterions to the interface.
	It also decreases the water density at the interface because of steric
	effects of the iodide ions. The number of contacts between the surface
	carbons and water decreases in the case of NaI solutions but is unchanged
	for NaF solutions. The orientation of the water-ion and the water-water
	hydrogen bond vector orientations near the interface is discussed
	in detail. 1520-6106}

  abstract = {It is possible to infer aspects of an organism's lifestyle from its

	issue by modelling evolution of the reduced genomes of endosymbiotic
	bacteria. The diversity of gene content in these bacteria may reflect
	both variation in selective forces and contingency-dependent loss
	of alternative pathways. Using an in silico representation of the
	metabolic network of Escherichia coli, we examine the role of contingency
	by repeatedly simulating the successive loss of genes while controlling
	for the environment. The minimal networks that result are variable
	in both gene content and number. Partially different metabolisms
	can thus evolve owing to contingency alone. The simulation outcomes
	do preserve a core metabolism, however, which is over-represented
	in strict intracellular bacteria. Moreover, differences between minimal
	networks based on lifestyle are predictable: by simulating their
	respective environmental conditions, we can model evolution of the
	gene content in Buchnera aphidicola and Wigglesworthia glossinidia
	with over 80\% accuracy. We conclude that, at least for the particular
	cases considered here, gene content of an organism can be predicted
	with knowledge of its distant ancestors and its current lifestyle.},

However, the reported data at high temperatures and pressures are scarce. The present study focuses on simulating the interfacial tension (IFT) of mixtures of water with i) toluene (water/toluene), ii) n-dodecane (water/n-dodecane) and iii) a 50:50 %% wt toluene:n-dodecane mixture (water/toluene/n-dodecane), at 1.83 MPa and temperatures ranging from 383.15 to 443.15 K. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with atomistic molecular models, developed primarily for biomolecular systems were employed. In the simulations performed, the effects of the water model and the scaling of interatomic interactions by introducing a binary interaction parameter, kij, were assessed for the accurate reproduction of experimental data. The combination of the TIP4P/2005, SPC/E and TIP3P water models with the GAFF and Lipid14 force fields for toluene and n-dodecane respectively, coupled with appropriate binary interaction parameters, kij, for the interaction of carbon with oxygen atoms were found to yield accurate results in the case of binary mixtures. For the water/toluene/n-dodecane mixture, all force field combinations tested resulted in overestimated IFT values for the whole range of state points examined. Our simulations show that these widely used force fields, originating from the world of biomolecular simulations, are suitable candidates in the study of binary water/oil mixtures. Nevertheless, the introduction of the kij scaling parameter is not sufficient to allow the accurate reproduction of experimental IFT data for ternary water/oil/oil mixtures."

  abstract = {Water exhibits many unusual properties that are essential for the

	life at extreme conditions, leading to conjectures that life may
	have originated in deep-sea vents. Molecular simulation can be very
	useful in exploring biological and chemical systems, particularly
	at extreme conditions for which experiments are either difficult
	or impossible; however this scenario entails an accurate molecular
	model for water applicable over a wide range of state conditions.
	Here, we present a Gaussian charge polarizable model (GCPM) based
	on the model developed earlier by Chialvo and Cummings [Fluid Phase
	Equilib. 150, 73 (1998)] which is, to our knowledge, the first that
	satisfies the water monomer and dimer properties, and simultaneously
	yields very accurate predictions of dielectric, structural, vapor-liquid
	equilibria, and transport properties, over the entire fluid range.
	This model would be appropriate for simulating biological and chemical
	systems at both ambient and extreme conditions. The particularity
	of the GCPM model is the use of Gaussian distributions instead of
	points to represent the partial charges on the water molecules. These
	charge distributions combined with a dipole polarizability and a
	Buckingham exp-6 potential are found to play a crucial role for the
	successful and simultaneous predictions of a variety of water properties.
	This work not only aims at presenting an accurate model for water,
	but also at proposing strategies to develop classical accurate models

	originally synthesized under conditions of iron depletion to build
	a reduced antenna system as a replacement for large phycobilisomes.

  abstract = {We validate here the Two-Phase Thermodynamics (2PT) method for calculating
	the standard molar entropies and heat capacities of common liquids.
	In 2PT, the thermodynamics of the system is related to the total
	density of states (DoS), obtained from the Fourier Transform of the
	velocity autocorrelation function. For liquids this DoS is partitioned
	into a diffusional component modeled as diffusion of a hard sphere
	gas plus a solid component for which the DoS(upsilon) -> 0 as upsilon
	-> 0 as for a Debye solid. Thermodynamic observables are obtained
	by integrating the DoS with the appropriate weighting functions.
	In the 2PT method, two parameters are extracted from the DoS self-consistently
	to describe diffusional contributions: the fraction of diffusional
	modes, f, and DoS(0). This allows 2PT to be applied consistently
	and without re-parameterization to simulations of arbitrary liquids.
	We find that the absolute entropy of the liquid can be determined
	accurately from a single short MD trajectory (20 ps) after the system
	is equilibrated, making it orders of magnitude more efficient than
	commonly used perturbation and umbrella sampling methods. Here, we
	present the predicted standard molar entropies for fifteen common
	solvents evaluated from molecular dynamics simulations using the
	AMBER, GAFF, OPLS AA/L and Dreiding II forcefields. Overall, we find
	that all forcefields lead to good agreement with experimental and
	previous theoretical values for the entropy and very good agreement
	in the heat capacities. These results validate 2PT as a robust and
	efficient method for evaluating the thermodynamics of liquid phase
	systems. Indeed 2PT might provide a practical scheme to improve the
	intermolecular terms in forcefields by comparing directly to thermodynamic},

	results of liquid ethanol structure, although the polarizable model

	The polarizable model allows for a monotonic variation of the average

Here, we compare structural data from recent x-ray laser scattering measurements of water at 1 bar and temperatures down to 227 K with structural properties computed for several different water models using molecular dynamics simulations. Based on this comparison, we critically evaluate four different thermodynamic scenarios that have been invoked to explain the unusual behavior of water. The critical point-free model predicts small variations in the tetrahedrality with decreasing temperature, followed by a stepwise change at the liquid-liquid transition around 228 K at ambient pressure. This scenario is not consistent with the experimental data that instead show a smooth and accelerated variation in structure from 320 to 227 K. Both the singularity-free model and ice coarsening hypothesis give trends that indirectly indicate an increase in tetrahedral structure with temperature that is too weak to be consistent with experiment. A model that includes an apparent divergent point (ADP) at high positive pressure, however, predicts structural development consistent with our experimental measurements. The terminology ADP, instead of the commonly used liquid-liquid critical point, is more general in that it focuses on the growing fluctuations, whether or not they result in true criticality. Extrapolating this model beyond the experimental data, we estimate that an ADP in real water may lie around $1500 \pm 250$ bars and $190 \pm 6$ K.}

	and the dipolar solvent molecules are characterized by the so-called
	Stockmayer potential. The technique of molecular dynamics simulation
	is employed to calculate the density profiles and the orientational
	structure of the interfaces, the surface tension, the translational
	and rotational diffusion coefficients, and also the dipole orientational
	relaxation times of both interfacial and bulk molecules. It is found
	that the ions prefer to stay in the interior of the solutions and
	tend to avoid the surfaces. The dipole vectors of the interfacial
	solvent molecules tend to align parallel to the surfaces. The surface
	tension shows an increasing trend with increase of ion concentration,
	and this increase of the surface tension is found to be the net outcome
	of a decrease of the solvent-solvent contribution and an increase
	of the ion-solvent and ion-ion contributions. The dynamical properties
	of the interfaces are found to be different from those of the corresponding
	bulk liquid phases. The solvent molecules at the interfaces rotate
	and translate in the parallel direction at a faster rate than that
	of bulk molecules. The perpendicular diffusion, however, occurs at
	a slower rate for the interfacial molecules. Also, on increase of
	ion concentration of the solutions, the dynamical properties of the
	interfaces are found to change differently from those of the bulk
	solutions. The equilibrium and dynamical results of the present interfacial
	solutions are also compared with the results of liquid-vapor interfaces
	of aqueous NaCl solutions that were reported in an earlier study

	computational methods is one of the most promising methods to search

	methodologies, available computer programs do not easily address
	problems such as: structural optimization of compounds in a screening
	library, receptor flexibility/induced-fit, and accurate prediction
	of protein-ligand interactions. It has been shown that structural
	optimization of chemical compounds and that post-docking optimization
	in multi-step structure-based virtual screening approaches help to
	further improve the overall efficiency of the methods. To address
	some of these points, we developed the program AMMOS for refining
	both, the 3D structures of the small molecules present in chemical
	libraries and the predicted receptor-ligand complexes through allowing
	partial to full atom flexibility through molecular mechanics optimization.
	Results: The program AMMOS carries out an automatic procedure that
	allows for the structural refinement of compound collections and
	energy minimization of protein-ligand complexes using the open source
	program AMMP. The performance of our package was evaluated by comparing
	the structures of small chemical entities minimized by AMMOS with
	those minimized with the Tripos and MMFF94s force fields. Next, AMMOS
	was used for full flexible minimization of protein-ligands complexes
	obtained from a multi-step virtual screening. Enrichment studies
	of the selected pre-docked complexes containing 60\% of the initially
	added inhibitors were carried out with or without final AMMOS minimization
	on two protein targets having different binding pocket properties.
	AMMOS was able to improve the enrichment after the pre-docking stage
	with 40 to 60\% of the initially added active compounds found in
	the top 3\% to 5\% of the entire compound collection. Conclusion:
	The open source AMMOS program can be helpful in a broad range of
	in silico drug design studies such as optimization of small molecules
	or energy minimization of pre-docked protein-ligand complexes. Our
	enrichment study suggests that AMMOS, designed to minimize a large
	number of ligands pre-docked in a protein target, can successfully
	be applied in a final post-processing step and that it can take into
	account some receptor flexibility within the binding site area. 1471-2105}

  abstract = {To approach the question of what life is, we first have to state that
	life exists exclusively as the ``being-alive{''} of discrete spatio-temporal
	entities. The simplest ``unit{''} that can legitimately be considered
	to be alive is an intact prokaryotic cell as a whole. In this review,
	I discuss critically various aspects of the nature and singularity
	of living beings from the biologist's point of view. In spite of
	the enormous richness of forms and performances in the biotic realm,
	there is a considerable uniformity in the chemical ``machinery of
	life,{''} which powers all organisms. Life represents a dynamic
	state; it is performance of a system of singular kind: ``life-as-action{''}
	approach. All ``life-as-things{''} hypotheses are wrong from the
	beginning. Life is conditioned by certain substances but not defined
	by them. Living systems are endowed with a power to maintain their
	inherent functional order (organization) permanently against disruptive
	influences. The term organization inherently involves the aspect
	of functionality, the teleonomic, purposeful cooperation of structural
	and functional elements. Structures in turn require information for
	their specification, and information presupposes a source. This source
	is constituted in living systems by the nucleic acids. Organisms
	are unique in having a capacity to use, maintain, and replicate internal
	information, which yields the basis for their specific organization
	in its perpetuation. The existence of a genome is a necessary condition
	for life and one of the absolute differences between living and non-living
	matter. Organization includes both what makes life possible and what
	is determined by it. It is not something ``implanted{''} into the
	living beings but has its origin and capacity for maintenance within
	the system itself. It is the essence of life. The property of being
	alive we can consider as an emergent property of cells that corresponds
	to a certain level of self-maintained complex order or organization.},

	a ``bimodal'' behavior with time constants of 1.3 and 16 ps, mirroring
	relaxation of the free/quasifree water molecules and surface-bound
	water layer (minimum binding energy of 1-2 kcal/mol). The observed
	slow decay of 16 ps for tryptophan in the native protein differs

	unfolding, we also studied hydration dynamics when Monellin was denatured

	different behavior: 3.5 and 56 ps. Comparing with the results of
	experiments on free tryptophan in the same concentration of the denaturing

	bulk-type solvation in the 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. However,
	the absence of the 16-ps decay and appearance of the 56-ps component
	reflects a more ``rigid solvation,'' which is likely to involve the

	reversible folding on the time scales accessible to MD simulation
	and thus allows a direct one-to-one comparison of efficiency. The

	simulations starting from a random set of initial configurations
	were approximately an order of magnitude more computationally efficient
	than a single 800 ns conventional MD simulation for this system at
	the lowest temperature investigated (275 K). However, whereas it
	was found that T-REMD simulations are more than four times more efficient
	than multiple independent MD simulations at one temperature (300
	K) the actual increase in conformation sampling was only twofold.
	The overall gain in efficiency using REMD resulted primarily from
	the ordering of different conformational states over temperature,

	on the basis of a four-to-one rule. This systematic reduction of
	the degrees of freedom allows for computationally efficient calculation
	of the structure and dynamics of molecular assemblies for larger

	here an unprecedented view of spontaneous protein assembly in biomembranes.
	Systems with up to 16 rhodopsin molecules at a protein-to-lipid ratio

	obtained for four different phospholipid environments showed that
	localized adaptation of the membrane bilayer to the presence of receptors
	is reproducibly most pronounced near transmembrane helices 2, 4,
	and 7. This local membrane deformation appears to be a key factor
	defining the rate, extent, and orientational preference of protein-protein
	association. The implications of our findings are discussed within
	a framework of a generalized mechanism of membrane protein self-assembly.},

abstract = { A thorough analysis of molecular vibrations in the binary system hydrogen chloride/water is presented considering a set of small mixed and pure clusters. In addition to the conventional normal-mode analysis based on the diagonalization of the Hessian, anharmonic frequencies were obtained from the perturbative VPT2 and PT2-VSCF method using hybrid density functional theory. For all normal modes, potential energy curves were modeled by displacing the atoms from the minimum geometry along the normal mode vectors. Three model potentials, a harmonic potential, a Morse potential, and a fourth order polynomial, were applied to fit these curves. From these data, it was possible not only to characterize distinct vibrations as mainly harmonic, anharmonic, or involving higher order terms but also to extract force constants, k, and anharmonicity constants, xe. By investigating all different types of intramolecular vibrations including covalent stretching or bending vibrations and intermolecular vibrations such as librations, we could demonstrate that while vibrational frequencies can be obtained applying scaling factors to harmonic results, useful anharmonicity constants cannot be predicted in such a way and the usage of more elaborate vibrational methods is necessary. For each particular type of molecular vibration, we could however determine a relationship between the wavenumber or wavenumber shift and the anharmonicity constant, which allows us to estimate mode dependent anharmonicity constants for larger clusters in the future. }

	ion pairs in water clusters have been investigated by means of Monte
	Carlo simulations with model potentials. Attention was also paid
	to the structure of single ion-water Na+(H2O)(n) and I-(H2O)(n) clusters,
	which are found to be non-spherically symmetric at room temperature.
	In agreement with earlier studies, I-(H2O)(n) clusters exhibit surface
	structures, with the ``hydrophobic'' iodide ion sitting at the surface
	of a water network, while room-temperature Na+(H2O)(n) clusters exhibit
	a solvation shell structure, where solvent molecules beyond the first
	solvation shell tend to accumulate on one side of the cluster instead
	of forming a spherical droplet. Both ``contact'' ion pairs (CIP)
	and solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIP) are found to have surface
	structures for the smaller clusters while both interior and surface
	structures may exist at room temperature for cluster size of 32,
	A remarkable Feature of the ion pair cluster structural properties
	is that they are very much akin to those for individual ion-water
	clusters, especially for SSIPs, and some insight into the ion pair
	cluster structures can thus be gained from single ion-water cluster
	structures. We propose that the (small) extent of solvent-solvent
	hydrogen bonding and the magnitude of the (large) solvent dipole
	moments in the clusters can be used to illustrate the extent of the
	perturbation introduced by the ions or the ion pairs in the solvent
	environments. In contrast to the ion pair free energetics investigated
	in previous work, ion-water and salt-water cluster structural properties
	are rather insensitive to the choice of model potentials, whether
	one employs non-polarizable optimized potentials for liquid simulations
	(OPLS) such as TIP4P/OPLS or polarizable optimized potentials for
	cluster simulations. The structure of NaI(H2O)(n) CIP and SSIP clusters
	have implications for the NaI(H2O)(n) cluster photodissociation dynamics.
	The large solvent dipole moments obtained for NaI(H2O)(n) clusters
	are indicative of increasingly larger local solvent dipoles in the
	clusters, which may then grow large enough to dipole-bind an electron
	upon cluster photoexcitation. Photoexcitation of the larger clusters
	might then proceed via a different route than it does for the small
	clusters and isolated NaI possibly involving a charge-transfer-to-solvent
	excited state akin to that of I-(H2O)(n) clusters. For the NaI photodissociation
	pathway, the surface structure of the small NaI(H2O)(n) clusters
	may imply a slow change in the reaction dynamics with cluster size.

At first \{MD\} calculations were carried out applying twenty-nine combinations of ion-water interaction models at four salt concentrations. The structural predictions of the different models were compared, the contributions of different structural motifs to the partial pair correlation functions (PPCF) were determined. Particle configurations obtained from \{MD\} simulations were further refined using the \{RMC\} method to get better agreement with experimental X-ray and neutron diffraction data. The \{PPCFs\} calculated from \{MD\} simulations were fitted together with the experimental structure factors to construct structural models that are as consistent as possible with both the experimental results and the results of the \{MD\} simulations. The \{MD\} models were validated according to the quality of the fits. Although none of the tested \{MD\} models can describe the structure perfectly at the highest investigated concentration, their comparison made it possible to determine the main structural properties of that solution as well. It was found that four nearest neighbors (oxygen atoms and chloride ions together) are around a lithium ion at each concentration, while in the surroundings of the chloride ion hydrogen atom pairs are replaced by one lithium ion as the concentration increases. While in pure liquid water four water molecules can be found around a central water molecule, near the solubility limit nearly all water molecules are connected to two chloride ions (via their hydrogen atoms) and one lithium ion (by their oxygen atoms).

To guide our path towards that goal and to measure our progress, we have developed{\textemdash}building on earlier work of our group{\textemdash}a set of databases of reference data for a variety of energetic and structural properties in chemistry and physics. These databases include energies of molecular processes, such as atomization, complexation, proton addition and ionization; they also include molecular geometries and solid-state lattice constants, chemical reaction barrier heights, and cohesive energies and band gaps of solids. For this paper, we gather many of these databases into four comprehensive databases, two with 384 energetic data for chemistry and solid-state physics and another two with 68 structural data for chemistry and solid-state physics, and we test two wave function methods and 77 density functionals (12 Minnesota meta functionals and 65 others) in a consistent way across this same broad set of data. We especially highlight the Minnesota density functionals, but the results have broader implications in that one may see the successes and failures of many kinds of density functionals when they are all applied to the same data.

	drug have been investigated by molecular dynamics. Simulations centered
	about the HRV14 drug-binding pocket allow the reliable assessment
	of differences in capsid protein motions of HRV14 and drug-bound
	HRV14. We propose that the experimentally observed stabilization
	of the ligated virus arises from higher entropy, rather than enthalpy.
	Time-averaged interaction energies between the viral protein and
	molecules occupying the pocket are less favorable in the presence
	of the drug, consistent with the proposal that the observed stability
	arises from entropic effects. Interaction energies characterizing
	subunit-subunit contacts within one viral protomer are found to be
	substantially stronger than those between two protomers. Such distinction
	in subunit interaction would have clear implications on assembly
	and disassembly. Drug binding is found to affect large-scale, collective
	properties, while leaving local atomic properties unperturbed. Specifically,
	the simulations reveal a weakening of long-range correlations in
	atomic motions upon drug binding. On the other hand, neither the
	fast time scale RMS fluctuations of individual atomic positions nor
	the fluctuation build-up curves from the capsid P-sandwich forming
	the drug-binding pocket show a consistent distinction between the
	drug-bound and drug-free viral simulations. Collectively, the detailed
	description available from the simulations provides an understanding
	of the experimental observations on the drug-induced changes in thermal
	stability and protease sensitivity reported for picornaviruses. The
	predicted significance of binding entropy can be explored experimentally
	and should be considered in the design of new antiviral compounds.

   cases, both the rate of folding and the structure of the native state

   folding mechanism and the properties of the unfolded state depend
   substantially on the choice of force field. We thus conclude that
   although it is important to match a single, experimentally determined

   surface and the mechanism of folding.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, in Which proteins
   spontaneously and repeatedly fold and unfold, have recently been used to
   help elucidate the mechanistic principles that underlie the folding of
   fast-folding proteins. The extent to which the conclusions drawn from
   the analysis of such proteins, which fold on the microsecond timescale,
   apply to the millisecond or slower folding of naturally occurring
   proteins is, however, unclear. As a first attempt to address this
   outstanding issue, we examine here the folding of ubiquitin, a
   76-residue-long protein found in all eukaryotes that is known
   experimentally to fold on a millisecond timescale. Ubiquitin folding has
   been the subject of many experimental studies, but its slow folding rate
   has made it difficult to observe and characterize the folding process
   through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Here we determine the
   mechanism, thermodynamics, and kinetics of ubiquitin folding through
   equilibrium atomistic simulations. The picture emerging' from the
   simulations is in agreement with a view of ubiquitin folding suggested
   from previous experiments. Our findings related to the folding of
   ubiquitin are also consistent, for the most part, with the folding

Journal = {{J. Phys. Chem. B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{12935-12942}},
Abstract = {{Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are increasingly being used
   to describe the folding of individual proteins and protein domains at an
   atomic level of detail. Isolated protein domains, however, are rarely
   observed in vivo, where multidomain proteins and multimeric assemblies
   are far more common. It is clear that the folding of such proteins is
   often inextricably coupled with the process of dimerization; indeed,
   many protein monomers and protein domains are not stable in isolation,
   and fold to their native structures only when stabilized by interactions
   with other members of a protein complex. Here, we use equilibrium
   molecular dynamics simulations with an aggregate simulation length of 4
   ms to elucidate key aspects of the folding mechanism, and of the
   associated free-energy surface, of the Top7-CFr dimer, a 114-amino-acid
   protein homodimer with a mixed alpha/beta structure. In these
   simulations, we observed a number of folding and unfolding events. Each
   folding event was characterized by the assembly of two unfolded Top7-CFr
   monomers to form a stable, folded dimer. We found that the isolated
   monomer is unstable but that, early in the folding pathway, nascent
   native structure is stabilized by contacts between the two monomer
   subunits. These contacts are in some cases native, as in an
   induced-folding model, and in other cases non-native, as in a
   fly-casting mechanism. Occasionally, folding by conformational
   selection, in which both subunits form independently before
   dimerization, was also observed. Folding then proceeds through the
   sequential addition of strands to the protein beta sheet. Although the
   long-time-scale relaxation of the folding process can be well described
   by a single exponential, these simulations reveal the presence of a
   number of kinetic traps, characterized by structures in which individual
   strands are added in an incorrect order.}},

abstract = { Many proteins can be partially or completely disordered under physiological conditions. Structural characterization of these disordered states using experimental methods can be challenging, since they are composed of a structurally heterogeneous ensemble of conformations rather than a single dominant conformation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations should in principle provide an ideal tool for elucidating the composition and behavior of disordered states at an atomic level of detail. Unfortunately, MD simulations using current physics-based models tend to produce disordered-state ensembles that are structurally too compact relative to experiments. We find that the water models typically used in MD simulations significantly underestimate London dispersion interactions, and speculate that this may be a possible reason for these erroneous results. To test this hypothesis, we create a new water model, TIP4P-D, that approximately corrects for these deficiencies in modeling water dispersion interactions while maintaining compatibility with existing physics-based models. We show that simulations of solvated proteins using this new water model typically result in disordered states that are substantially more expanded and in better agreement with experiment. These results represent a significant step toward extending the range of applicability of MD simulations to include the study of (partially or fully) disordered protein states. }

abstract = {This Special Topic issue entitled “From Quantum Mechanics to Force Fields” is dedicated to the ongoing efforts of the theoretical chemistry community to develop a new generation of accurate force fields based on data from high-level electronic structure calculations and to develop faster electronic structure methods for testing and designing force fields as well as for carrying out simulations. This issue includes a collection of 35 original research articles that illustrate recent theoretical advances in the field. It provides a timely snapshot of recent developments in the generation of approaches to enable more accurate molecular simulations of processes important in chemistry, physics, biophysics, and materials science.
This special issue grew out of a series of Telluride Science Research Center (TSRC) workshops focused on the interface between electronic structure theory and accurate force fields that we have organized over the past eight years. In comparing the presentations at the first of these workshops in 2010 with that held last year (2016), it is clear that much progress has been made in this area over the past few years. This issue of JCP includes 35 manuscripts dealing with new developments in the force field design, the force-field based simulations, and the development of electronic structure methods that are computationally fast enough to tackle problems restricted to force fields in the past. The manuscripts in this issue can be characterized as falling into the following areas: (1) potential energy surfaces from ab initio data, (2) faster electronic structure based simulation methods, (3) new approaches for including many-body polarization, (4) ion solvation, and (5) novel force field methods. Obviously, some of the papers could be placed in more than one of these categories.
(1)	
PESs from ab initio data
The contribution of Wang and Bowman1 describes the development of an accurate two-body force field for the CO2-H2O dimer system based on CCSD(T)-F122 (Explicity Correlated Coupled-Cluster Singles Doubles and Noniterative Triples Correction) calculations. The dimer force field was combined with the many-body force field for water from the Paesani group3 and used to study CO2 encapsulated in an (H2O)20 dodecahedral cluster. Wheatley and co-workers4 describe the use of machine learning methods to develop potential energy surfaces from limited ab initio data, and Liu and Herbert5 present a detailed analysis of the N-body expansion and treatment of the basis set superposition error (BSSE) in such expansions. Paesani and co-workers6 present many-body potentials determined from CCSD(T)-F12 calculations for alkali ions interacting with water. Steffen and Hartke7 use an empirical valence bond extension of a quantum-mechanically derived force field to generate reliable potential energy surfaces that are used to compute reaction rate data for three representative systems.
(2)	
Faster electronic structure methods
David Sherrill and co-workers8 demonstrate that the CCSD(T)-F12 method gives interaction energies close to those from complete-basis-set-limit CCSD(T) calculations but at a greatly reduced computational cost. Shaw and co-workers9 introduce a neural network scheme for reweighting the various contributions to MP210 energies, demonstrating a 6-7 fold improvement in accuracy over traditional MP2 calculations. Song and Martínez11 report an implementation of analytical MP2 gradients using the tensor hyper-contraction scheme, demonstrating that with this approach MP2 gradients can be calculated with a quartic scaling with system size. Grimme and co-workers12 report a procedure for generating accurate intermolecular potential energy functions using data from their recently introduced tight-binding scheme.13 Wu, Shen, and Yang14 describe an internal force correction (determined using a machine-learning approach) for semi-empirical quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Cui and co-workers15 introduce a method combining coupled cluster and density-functional theory (DFT) methods to calculate the binding molecular energies of dimers in solution.
(3)	
Models for polarization
Several articles analyze and present new approaches for describing many-body polarization. Brooks and co-workers16 compare force fields that use atom-centered multipoles and point-inducible dipoles to those that use point-charges (including off-atom-centered sites) and Drude oscillators17 to describe polarization. It is demonstrated that one can transfer parameters between the two types of force fields. Head-Gordon and co-workers18 find that the AMOEBA force field19 overestimates polarization, with the overestimation being traced to the Thole damping model.20 Misquitta and Price21 introduce an anisotropic polarizable atom-atom force field for pyridine which they use to model polymorphs of crystalline pyridine. Piquemal and co-workers22 introduce an efficient scheme for calculating analytical gradients in the truncated conjugate gradient scheme. The resulting method enables long-time MD simulations with polarizable force fields. The article of Choi, Vazhappilly, and Jordan23 describes a mixed real space/momentum space discrete variable representation (DVR) approach24 for solving for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a model Hamiltonian approach for treating non-valence correlation bound anions of fullerenes and other systems.
(4)	
Ion solvation
Schenter and Mundy25 use MD simulations with DFT energies/forces to calculate solvation-free energies of single ions in water. They conclude that real ions are much more complex than simple charged hard spheres. Wick26 develops and applies a multi-state empirical valence-bond model to characterize HCl, HBr, and HI at the air/water interface. Spezia et al.27 describe the development of new polarizable and non-polarizable force fields for calculating the hydration properties of ions. Chang and Dang28 use polarizable force fields to study ethylene carbonate exchange between the first and second solvation shells around Li+ and the dissociation kinetics of Li+[BF−4]Li+BF4− and Li+[PF−6]Li+PF6− in ethylene carbonate. Masella and co-workers29 report MD simulations using polarizable force fields of carboxylate/methylated ammonium pairs in bulk water and in salt solutions. Pollard and Beck30 and Andrés Cisneros and co-workers31 present simulations modeling processes in Li+ ion batteries. Whereas, Beck and co-workers use DFT simulations to study Li+ ions in ethylene and propylene carbonates and conclude that polarization is important, Cisneros and co-workers use polarizable force fields in simulations of spirocyclic pyrrolidinium with BF−4BF4− and Li+. Chaudhari, Rempe, and Pratt32 use ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in combination with quasi-chemical theory33 to study the shell structure of F−(aq). Ahlstrand, Zukerman Schpector, and Friedman34 carry out simulations of alkali ion-acetate systems to better understand the interaction of these ions in aqueous solutions, with the goal of understanding protein solvation in electrolyte solutions. Ren and co-workers35 use AMOEBA-type polarizable force fields to study Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions interacting with model compounds for amino acids.

Novel force field methods
Several papers in the special issue deal with accurate modeling of molecular charge distributions. Meuwly and co-workers36 present a novel minimal distributed charge model based on off-centered point charges and compare it to the results of electrostatic potentials obtained from distributed multipoles and atom-centered point charge approaches. Laboda and Millot37 study the geometry dependence of the charge distribution of water as a function of OH bond lengths and HOH angle in order to design flexible electrostatic models ranging from point charge to distributed multipole models. Dharmawardhana and Ichiye38 examine the influence of the shape of the molecular charge distribution on liquid state properties by correlating multipoles of non-polarizable water models with their liquid state properties in computer simulations. Chong and co-workers39 study an alternative to the fixed charge ff15ipq protein force field, first, deriving bonded parameters in the context of the ff15ipq solution phase charge set and, second, taking bonded parameters and running simulations with the vacuum phase charge set used to derive those parameters. Ryan Rogers and Wang40 describe the determination of atomic Millikan-Thomson charges by computationally determined atomic forces. Such charges provide information about charge-transfer phenomena. Other articles in the special issue deal with force field generation strategies. For example, Kent and co-workers41 combine information from configurational energies and forces generated in molecular dynamics simulations and use this information to optimize a force field by minimizing the statistical distance similarity metric. Voth and co-workers42 propose novel multiscale reactive molecular dynamics (MS-RMD) force fields whose design utilizes relative entropy minimization. Finally, two papers describe new force fields. Salanne and co-workers43 develop a polarizable model for sodium borosilicate glasses which is validated against neutron diffraction and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, and Coupry, Addicoat, and Heine44 include an explicit treatment of hydrogen bonds in the Universal Force Field45 for metal-organic frameworks, hydrates, and host-guest complex applications.

	approach does not take into account interactions between the end
	units and the chain repeat units. This interaction modifies the derived
	compressibility of the methylene groups reducing their compressibility

	relation between structure and function in nanoscopic objects and

	all implies a thorough understanding on many length and correspondingly
	time scales, ranging from (sub)atomistic to macroscopic. Presently,
	computer simulations play an increasingly important, if not central,
	role. Some problems do not require specific atomistic details, whereas
	others require them only locally. However, in many cases this strict
	separation is not sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of
	systems, and flexible simulation schemes are required that link the
	different levels of resolution. We here give a general view of the
	problem regarding soft matter and discuss some specific examples
	of linked simulation techniques at different resolution levels. We
	then discuss a recently developed flexible simulation scheme, the
	AdResS method, which allows one to adaptively change the resolution

  abstract = {The entropy of hydration of non-polar and polar groups upon protein
	unfolding has been estimated for four globular proteins in the temperature
	range 5 to 125oC, using structural information on the groups of these
	proteins exposed to water in the native and unfolded states and the
	entropies of transfer of various model compounds from the gaseous
	phase to water. The latter was calculated using the molar scale.
	It is shown that the entropies of hydration of non-polar and polar
	groups are both negative, but change in different directions with
	increasing temperature: the entropy of hydration of polar groups
	increases in absolute magnitude, while the entropy of hydration of
	non-polar groups decreases and becomes zero at 122oC for aliphatic
	groups and at 104oC for aromatic groups, with a change in sign at
	higher temperature. The configurational entropy was estimated by
	comparing the entropy of overall hydration with the total entropy
	of protein unfolding. Using previously determined enthalpies of hydration
	of polar and non-polar groups and disruption of the internal bonds,
	the Gibbs energies of hydration of protein groups and breaking of
	the hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions have been estimated.
	It was shown that hydration of the polar groups and aromatic non-polar
	groups destabilizes the native protein structure, while hydration
	of aliphatic non-polar groups (hydrophobic hydration) stabilizes
	it; however, the main stabilization effect comes from the internal
	van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonding. Analysis of the
	factors contributing to the stability of the folded protein conformation
	shows that it is the hydration of polar groups that is mainly responsible
	for the cold denaturation of proteins.}

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput
	technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic
	and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated
	simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules
	with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in
	performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular
	interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment.
	These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that
	can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed
	computing or cloud resources.
	
	RESULTS: Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and
	features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS
	4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide
	classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids,
	and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules
	built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well
	as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading
	for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including
	windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels
	and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high
	performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively
	parallel simulations.

  abstract = {Human serum albumin, the most abundant protein found in blood plasma,
	transports a great variety of ligands in the circulatory system and
	undergoes reversible conformational transitions over a wide range
	of pH values. We report here our systematic studies of solvation
	dynamics and local rigidity in these conformations using a single
	intrinsic tryptophan (W214) residue as a local molecular probe. With
	femtosecond resolution, we observed a robust bimodal distribution
	of time scales for all conformational isomers. The initial solvation
	occurs in several picoseconds, representing the local librational/
	rotational motions, followed by the dynamics, in the tens to hundreds
	of picoseconds, which result from the more bonded water in the tryptophan
	crevice. Under the physiological condition of neutral pH, we measured
	similar to 100 ps for the decay of the solvation correlation function
	and observed a large wobbling motion at the binding site that is
	deeply buried in a crevice, revealing the softness of the binding
	pocket and the large plasticity of the native structure. At acidic
	pH, the albumin molecule transforms to an extended conformation with
	a large charge distribution at the surface, and a similar temporal
	behavior was observed. However, at the basic pH, the protein opens
	the crevice and tightens its globular structure, and we observed
	significantly faster dynamics, 25-45 ps. These changes in the solvation
	dynamics are correlated with the conformational transitions and related
	to their structural integrity. 1520-6106}

abstract = { In this work, we investigate whether experimental surface tension measurements, which are less sensitive to quantum and self-polarization corrections, are able to replace the usual reliance on the heat of vaporization as experimental reference data for fitting force field models of molecular liquids. To test this hypothesis, we develop the fitting protocol necessary to utilize surface tension measurements in the ForceBalance optimization procedure to determine revised parameters for both three-point and four-point water models TIP3P-ST and TIP4P-ST. We find that the incorporation of surface tension in the fit results in a rigid three-point model that reproduces the correct temperature of maximum density of water for the first time but also leads to overstructuring of the liquid and less accurate transport properties. The rigid four-point TIP4P-ST model is highly accurate for a broad range of thermodynamic and kinetic properties, with similar performance compared to recently developed four-point water models. The results show surface tension to be a useful fitting property in general, especially when self-polarization corrections or nuclear quantum corrections are not readily available for correcting the heat of vaporization as is the case for other molecular liquids. }

   abstract = "We carried out the modeling of the Optical Kerr effect (OKE) signals of several metallic chloride ionic solutions to study the microscopic origin of the cation effect on the OKE spectral features. The modeling was based on molecular dynamic simulation and the dipole-induced-dipole method for induced polarization calculation. Decent agreement was achieved between the simulation and the experiment. An extended projection method was adapted to decompose the OKE signals into the contributions from the reorientational and the collision-induced motions of the bulk and the shell water. Further analysis suggested that the different cation effects on the OKE measured relaxation time constant originate from their different water affinities. The weak water affinity of Na + causes the water in its first solvation shell to be only insignificantly perturbed in dynamics and frequently exchanges with water in bulk, which results in an negligible concentration dependence of the OKE time constant. The OKE time constants of Mg 2 + and Al 3 + have much stronger dependences on concentration due to their stronger water affinities, which create the more stable first solvation shells and slower water motion in the shell. Compared with Mg 2 +, Al 3 + can more significantly retard the water motion outside of the shell, which causes an even stronger concentration dependence of the OKE time constant. Our study provided a microscopic picture on how the cation effect on the water dynamics is reflected in the OKE measurements."

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{5282-5288}},
Abstract = {{In Mediterranean regions where the population is rapidly growing, the
   risk of water resource contamination by wastewater is likely to
   increase. This is the case of the Herault watershed (south of France),
   where the presence of treated wastewater in surface and ground waters
   has been shown in a previous study. To assess the consequence of these
   wastewater contaminations as regards pharmaceuticals and other organic
   compounds, 16 common pharmaceuticals (amitryptilin, acetylsalicylic
   acid, carbamazepine, clenbuterol, diazepam, diclofenac, doxepin,
   gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, imipramine, ketoprofen, naproxen, nordiazepam,
   paracetamol, salbutamol, and terbutalin) as well as wastewater related
   pollutants (caffeine, gadolinium anomaly, and boron) were analyzed in
   wells pumped for potable water supply and in two wastewater treatment
   plant (WWTP) effluents. In addition, a monitoring along the Lergue River
   (the main tributary of the Herault River) was achieved to assess
   pharmaceutical behavior in surface waters. Pharmaceuticals and other
   wastewater-related contaminants are present in several reservoirs tapped
   for drinking water, confirming wastewater contamination; paracetamol,
   caffeine, and diclofenac are the most frequently detected. Paracetamol
   is present at rather high concentrations (up to 11 mu g/L and 211 ng/L,
   respectively, in a wastewater effluent and in a drinking water sample).
   Though degradable in WWTP, caffeine is commonly encountered in surface
   waters and detected in highly polluted groundwater. On the contrary,
   acetylsalicylic acid concentrations are generally low despite a large
   consumption in France; this is related to its metabolism in humans and
   rapid degradation in the aquatic environment. The monitoring of
   pharmaceuticals along the Lergue River shows that dilution is sufficient
   to decrease pharmaceutical values.}},

  abstract = {The packing and orientation of water molecules in the vicinity of
	solutes strongly influence the solute hydration thermodynamics in
	aqueous solutions. Here we study the charge density dependent hydration
	of a broad range of spherical monovalent ionic solutes (with solute
	diameters from similar to0.4 nm to 1.7 nm) through molecular dynamics
	simulations in the simple point charge model of water. Consistent
	with previous experimental and theoretical studies, we observe a
	distinct asymmetry in the structure and thermodynamics of hydration
	of ions. In particular, the free energy of hydration of negative
	ions is more favorable than that of positive ions of the same size.
	This asymmetry persists over the entire range of solute sizes and
	cannot be captured by a continuum description of the solvent. The
	favorable hydration of negative ions arises primarily from the asymmetric
	charge distribution in the water molecule itself, and is reflected
	in (i) a small positive electrostatic potential at the center of
	a neutral solute, and (ii) clear structural (packing and orientation)
	differences in the hydration shell of positive and negative ions.
	While the asymmetry arising from the positive potential can be quantified
	in a straightforward manner, that arising from the structural differences
	in the fully charged states is difficult to quantify. The structural
	differences are highest for the small ions and diminish with increasing
	ion size, converging to hydrophobiclike hydration structure for the
	largest ions studied here. We discuss semiempirical measures following
	Latimer, Pitzer, and Slansky [J. Chem. Phys. 7, 108 (1939)] that
	account for these structural differences through a shift in the ion
	radius. We find that these two contributions account completely for
	the asymmetry of hydration of positive and negative ions over the
	entire range of ion sizes studied here. We also present preliminary
	calculations of the dependence of ion hydration asymmetry on the
	choice of water model that demonstrate its sensitivity to the details
	of ion-water interactions. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

	Both reactive force field and combined QM-MM methodologies have been
	and are being developed to study reactivity at this boundary between
	molecules and the solid state. There have been more than 1500 publications
	since the mid-1990s, on combined QM-MM methodologies. Limitations
	in current models include the distortional characteristics of force
	field potential terms, the smooth transit from one potential surface
	to another, rather than surface hopping, and the blending of electrostatics
	between QM and MM portions of a QM-MM model. Functional forms, potential
	surface coupling terms, and parameterization strategies for the Approximate
	Pair Theory (APT), a next generation reactive force field model,
	are described. The APT model has been developed to correct a number
	of limitations in current reactive force field models as well as
	providing a foundation for a next generation QM-MM model. Chemical
	bonding concepts are used to develop fully dissociative bond stretch,
	bend, torsion, and inversion valence terms. Quantum mechanics also
	provides functional forms for potential surface coupling terms that
	permit a general description of reactivity from hydrogen bonding,
	through non-classical carbocations and cracking, to olefin polymerization,
	oxidation, and metathesis. Van der Waals, electrostatic, and metallic
	bonding models also derive from quantum mechanical resonance. Finally,
	Pauli Principle-based orthogonality provides a way to electrostatically
	couple the QM and MM portions of a QM-MM model that will support
	arbitrarily large basis sets.},

  abstract = {A theory is developed for surface energy exchanges in well-mixed,
	partly open systems, embracing fully open and fully closed systems
	as limits. Conservation equations for entropy and water vapour are
	converted into an exact rate equation for the potential saturation
	deficit D in a well-mixed, partly open region. The main contributions
	to changes in D arise from (1) the flux of D at the surface, dependent
	on a conductance g(q) that is a weighted sum of the bulk aerodynamic
	and surface conductances; and (2) the `exchange' flux of D with the
	external environment by entrainment or advection, dependent on a
	conductance g(e) that is identifiable with the entrainment velocity
	when the partly open region is a growing convective boundary layer
	(CBL). The system is fully open when g(e)/g(q) --> infinity, and
	fully closed when g(e)/g(q) --> 0. The equations determine the steady
	state surface energy balance (SEB) in a partly open system, the associated
	steady-state deficit, and the settling time scale needed to reach
	the steady state. The general result for the steady-state SEB corresponds
	to the equations of conventional combination theory for the SEB of
	a vegetated surface, with the surface-layer deficit replaced by the
	external deficit and with g(q) replaced by the series sum (g(q)(-)1
	+ g(e)(-)1)(-)1. In the fully open limit D is entirely externally
	prescribed, while in the fully closed limit, D is internally determined
	and the SEB approaches thermodynamic equilibrium energy partition.
	In the case of the CBL, the conductances g(q) and g(e) are themselves
	functions of D through short-term feedbacks, induced by entrainment
	in the case of g(e) and by both physiological and aerodynamic (thermal
	stability) processes in the case of g(q). The effects of these feedbacks
	are evaluated. It is found that a steady-state CBL is physically
	achievable only over surfaces with at least moderate moisture availability;
	that entrainment has a significant accelerating effect on equilibration;
	that the settling time scale is well approximated by h/(g(q) + g(e)),
	where h is the CBL depth; and that this scale is short enough to
	allow a steady state to evolve within a semi-diurnal time scale only
	when h is around 500 m or less.}

  journal = {Function. Ecol.},

  volume = {12},
  pages = {503--513},
  abstract = {1. Picophytoplankton are planktonic photosynthetic O-2-evolvers that
	can pass through 2 mu m-diameter pores; they include prokaryotic
	(eubacterial) and eukaryotic members and occur in freshwater and
	marine habitats. There are no photosynthetic reproductive and dispersal
	stages of benthic macrophytes of picoplanktonic size. The picophytoplankton
	condition appears to be derived and polyphyletic in both prokaryotes
	and eukaryotes. 2. Picophytoplankton are among the smallest free-living
	cells, despite having to contain the photosynthetic apparatus, which
	occupies about half of the cell volume, as well as core cellular
	machinery. The size of the smallest prokaryotic (0.6 mu m diameter)
	and eukaryotic (0.95 mu m diameter) picophytoplankton are close to
	the minimum possible size estimated from the occurrence of non-scalable
	essential components such as the genome and plasmalemma and other
	membranes. 3. Picophytoplankton cells have advantages relative to
	larger phytoplankton cells in terms of resource acquisition and the
	subsequent use of the resources in catalysing cell growth and reproduction.
	The smaller package effect in light harvesting means smaller resource
	(energy, C, N, Fe, Mn, Cu) costs of photon harvesting and transformation
	into chemical energy in small than in large cells. The smaller diffusion
	boundary layer around small cells, coupled with smaller nutrient
	fluxes per unit plasmalemma area needed to attain a given fraction
	of the maximum specific growth rate in smaller cells, increases the
	availability of low concentrations of nutrients to small relative
	to larger cells. If the supply of CO, to the core photosynthetic
	carboxylase ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase is purely
	by diffusion then smaller cells could satisfy their catalytic requirements
	with less of this enzyme whose synthesis has high energy, C and N
	costs. Overall, resources can be acquired, and used in growth, more
	effectively in smaller than in larger cells. 4. Some factors work
	against the conclusion in (3.) but, in most habitats, do not negate
	these conclusions. Examples related to non-scalable essential cell
	components are the use of energy, C, N and P in the genome and of
	energy, C, N, P and Fe in the plasma membrane. Transport-related
	factors include the increased potential cell volume-specific leakage
	of accumulated resources, and the greater cell volume-specific energy
	costs of motility at a given speed, in smaller than in larger cells.
	The smaller package effect in smaller cells involves a greater potential
	for photodamage by both photosynthetically active radiation and by
	UV-B. 5. Picophytoplankton occurrence is also a function of factors
	which lead to cell loss. Factors such as sinking out of the euphotic
	zone and parasitism by eukaryotes such as chytrids are less significant
	for picophytoplankton than for larger cells, whereas viral parasitism
	and grazing by appropriately sized grazers are likely to be at least
	as great for picophytoplankton as for larger cells. 6. The totality
	of the effects mentioned in (3.) above suggests that picophytoplankton
	should generally have higher specific growth rates (probably) in
	resource-saturated (photons, C, N, P, Fe, etc.) and (certainly) in
	resource-limited environments than do larger cells. The distribution
	of picophytoplankton is certainly consistent with their ability to
	capitalize on resource-limited environments: they contribute a larger
	fraction of biomass and productivity relative to larger cells in
	low-nutrient than in high-nutrient environments, and in low-light
	(e.g. the deep chlorophyll maximum) than in high-light environments.
	7. Sexual reproduction is apparently rare in picophytoplankton, with
	implications for species definition. There are probably relatively
	few species (hundreds or thousands) with very wide biogeographical
	ranges in marine or in freshwater habitats. The small size and (probably)
	low biodiversity means large numbers of individuals worldwide, e.g.
	c.10(26) individuals of the commonest species of the marine cyanobacterium
	Synechococcus. Picophytoplankton contribute at least one-tenth (i.e.
	in excess of 3 Pg C per year) to global aquatic net primary productivity.},

  volume = {72},
  pages = {1320--1332},
  abstract = {Conformational stability of the collagen triple helix affects its
	turnover and determines tissue homeostasis. Although it is known
	that the presence of imino acids (prolines or hydroxyprolines) confer
	stability to the molecule, little is known regarding the stability
	of the imino-poor region lacking imino acids, which plays a key role
	in collagen cleavage. In particular, there have been continuing debates
	about the role of water in collagen stability. We addressed these
	issues using molecular dynamics simulations on 30-residue long collagen
	triple helices, including a structure that has a biologically relevant
	9-residue imino-poor region from type III collagen (PDB ID: IBKV).
	A torsional map approach was used to characterize the conformational
	motion of the molecule that differ between imino-rich and imino-poor
	regions. At temperatures 300 K and above, unwinding initiates at
	a common cleavage site, the glycine-isoleucine bond in the imino-poor
	region. This provides a linkage between previous observations that
	unwinding of the imino-poor region is a requirement for collagenase
	cleavage, and that isolated collagen molecules are unstable at body
	temperature. We found that unwinding of the imino-poor region is
	controlled by dynamic water bridges between backbone atoms with average
	lifetimes on the order of a few picoseconds, as the degree of unwinding
	strongly correlated with the loss of water bridges, and unwinding
	could be either prevented or enhanced, respectively by enforcing
	or forbidding water bridge formation. While individual water bridges
	were short-lived in the imino-poor region, the hydration shell surrounding
	the entire molecule was stable even at 330 K. The diameter of the
	hydrated collagen including the first hydration shell was about 14
	A, in good agreement with the experimentally measured inter-collagen
	distances. These results elucidate the general role of water in collagen
	turnover: water not only affects collagen cleavage by controlling
	its torsional motion, but it also forms a larger-scale lubrication
	layer mediating collagen self-assembly.},

Here we find an overall RMSE of about 1.2 log units with both force fields. Results from GAFF and GAFF-DC seem to exhibit systematic biases in opposite directions for calculated cyclohexane/water partition coefficients.}

In this study we investigate the phenomenon of halogen bonding by carrying out ab initio calculations on the halomethane-formaldehyde complexes as well as the fluorine substituted FnH3-nCX···OCH2 dimers, where the halogen bonding halogens (X) are chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Coupled cluster (CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ) calculations indicate that the binding energies for these type of interactions lie in the range between −1.05 kcal/mol (H3CCl···OCH2) and −3.72 kcal/mol (F3CI···OCH2). One of the most important findings in this study is that, according to symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) analyses, halogen bonds are largely dependent on both electrostatic and dispersion type interactions. As the halogen atom involved in halogen bonding becomes larger the interaction strength for this type of interaction also gets larger and, interestingly, more electrostatic (and less dispersive) in character. Halogen bonding interactions also become stronger and more electrostatic upon substitution of (the very electronegative) fluorines onto the halomethane molecule. }}

One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.}}

The set, named X40, covers electrostatic interactions, London dispersion, hydrogen bonds, halogen bonding, halogen−π interactions, and stacking of halogenated aromatic molecules. Interaction energies at equilibrium geometries were calculated using a composite CCSD(T)/CBS scheme where the CCSD(T) contribution is calculated using triple-ζ basis sets with diffuse functions on all atoms but hydrogen. For each complex, we also provide 10 points along the dissociation curve calculated at the CCSD(T)/CBS level. We use this accurate reference to assess the accuracy of selected post-HF methods.}

abstract = { Data sets of benchmark interaction energies in noncovalent complexes are an important tool for quantifying the accuracy of computational methods used in this field, as well as for the development of new computational approaches. This review is intended as a guide to conscious use of these data sets. We discuss their construction and accuracy, list the data sets available in the literature, and demonstrate their application to validation and parametrization of quantum-mechanical computational methods. In practical model systems, the benchmark interaction energies are usually obtained using composite CCSD(T)/CBS schemes. To use these results as a benchmark, their accuracy should be estimated first. We analyze the errors of this methodology with respect to both the approximations involved and the basis set size. We list the most prominent data sets covering various aspects of the field, from general ones to sets focusing on specific types of interactions or systems. The benchmark data are then used to validate more efficient computational approaches, including those based on explicitly correlated methods. Special attention is paid to the transition to large systems, where accurate benchmarking is difficult or impossible, and to the importance of nonequilibrium geometries in parametrization of more approximate methods. }

	overcome by exchanging noninteracting replicas simulated at different
	temperatures. Our algorithm uses multiplexed-replicas with a number

	of configurations between these multiplexed-replicas are also tried,
	rendering the algorithm applicable to large-scale distributed computing
	(i.e., highly heterogeneous parallel computers with processors having
	different computational power). We demonstrate the enhanced sampling
	of this algorithm by simulating the folding thermodynamics of a 23
	amino acid miniprotein. We show that better convergence is achieved
	compared to constant temperature molecular dynamics simulation, with
	an efficient scaling to large number of computer processors. Indeed,
	this enhanced sampling results in (to our knowledge) the first example
	of a replica exchange algorithm that samples a folded structure starting

The MB-nrg PEFs are built upon the many-body expansion of the total energy and include the explicit treatment of one-body, two-body, and three-body interactions, with all higher-order contributions described by classical induction. This study focuses on the MB-nrg two-body terms describing the full-dimensional potential energy surfaces of the M+(H2O) dimers, where M+ = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+. The MB-nrg PEFs are derived entirely from “first principles” calculations carried out at the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster level including single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)-F12b] for Li+ and Na+ and at the CCSD(T) level for K+, Rb+, and Cs+. The accuracy of the MB-nrg PEFs is systematically assessed through an extensive analysis of interaction energies, structures, and harmonic frequencies for all five M+(H2O) dimers. In all cases, the MB-nrg PEFs are shown to be superior to both polarizable force fields and ab initio models based on density functional theory. As previously demonstrated for halide-water dimers, the MB-nrg PEFs achieve higher accuracy by correctly describing short-range quantum-mechanical effects associated with electron density overlap as well as long-range electrostatic many-body interactions.}

  abstract = { The reliable prediction of molecular properties is a vital task of
	computational chemistry. In recent years, density functional theory
	(DFT) has become a popular method for calculating molecular properties
	for a vast array of systems varying in size from small organic molecules
	to large biological compounds such as proteins. In this work, we
	assess the ability of many DFT methods to accurately determine atomic
	and molecular properties for small molecules containing elements
	commonly found in proteins, DNA, and RNA. These properties include
	bond lengths, bond angles, ground-state vibrational frequencies,
	electron affinities, ionization potentials, heats of formation, hydrogen-bond
	interaction energies, conformational energies, and reaction barrier
	heights. Calculations are carried out with the 3-21G*, 6-31G*, 3-21+G*,
	6-31+G*, 6-31++G*, cc-pVxZ, and aug-cc-pVxZ (x ) D and T) basis sets,
	while bond-distance and bond- angle calculations are also done using
	the cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets. Members of the popular functional
	classes, namely, local spin density approximation, generalized gradient
	approximation (GGA), meta-GGA, hybrid-GGA, and hybrid-meta-GGA, are
	considered in this work. For the purpose of comparison, Hartree-Fock
	and second-order many-body perturbation methods are also assessed
	in terms of their ability to determine these physical properties.
	Ultimately, it is observed that the split valence bases of the 6-31G
	variety provide accuracies similar to those of the more computationally
	expensive Dunning-type basis sets. Another conclusion from this survey
	is that the hybrid-meta-GGA functionals are typically among the most
	accurate functionals for all of the properties examined in this work.}

New torsional potentials were optimized based on density functional theory (DFT) scans at the ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p) level for potential energy surfaces of the backbone α and γ dihedral angles. In combination with previously reported improvements for the sugar puckering and glycosidic torsion terms, the new force field was validated through diverse molecular dynamics simulations for RNAs in aqueous solution. Results for dinucleotides and tetranucleotides revealed both accurate reproduction of 3J couplings from NMR and the avoidance of several unphysical states observed with other force fields. Simulations of larger systems with noncanonical motifs showed significant structural improvements over the previous OPLS-AA parameters. The new force field, OPLS-AA/M, is expected to perform competitively with other recent RNA force fields and to be compatible with OPLS-AA models for proteins and small molecules. }

After defining the scope of the article, which excludes anionic and most protonated systems, methods associated with measuring thermodynamic information for such systems are briefly recounted. An extensive set of tables detailing available thermodynamic information for the noncovalent interactions of metal cations with a host of ligands is provided. Ligands include small molecules (H2, NH3, CO, CS, H2O, CH3CN, and others), organic ligands (O- and N-donors, crown ethers and related molecules, MALDI matrix molecules), $\pi$-ligands (alkenes, alkynes, benzene, and substituted benzenes), miscellaneous inorganic ligands, and biological systems (amino acids, peptides, sugars, nucleobases, nucleosides, and nucleotides). Hydration of metalated biological systems is also included along with selected proton-based systems: 18-crown-6 polyether with protonated peptides and base-pairing energies of nucleobases. In all cases, the literature thermochemistry is evaluated and, in many cases, reanchored or adjusted to 0 K bond dissociation energies. Trends in these values are discussed and related to a variety of simple molecular concepts. }

OPLS3e accomplishes this by incorporating new parameter types that recognize moieties with greater chemical specificity and integrating an on-the-fly parametrization approach to the assignment of partial charges. As a consequence, OPLS3e leads to greater accuracy against performance benchmarks that assess small molecule conformational propensities, solvation, and protein–ligand binding. }

	As a consequence, the enthalpy of folding deviates by almost 3 kcal/mol

	efficiency of replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations

	applies to the important case of systems whose dynamics at long times
	is dominated by the slow interconversion between two metastable states.
	As a specific example, we consider the folding and unfolding of a
	protein. The efficiency is defined as the rate with which the error
	in an estimated equilibrium property, as measured by the variance
	of the estimator over repeated simulations, decreases with simulation
	time. For two-state systems, this rate is in general independent
	of the particular property. Our main result is that, with comparable
	computational resources used, the relative efficiency of REMD and
	molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is given by the ratio of the
	number of transitions between the two states averaged over all replicas
	at the different temperatures, and the number of transitions at the
	single temperature of the MD run. This formula applies if replica
	exchange is frequent, as compared to the transition times. High efficiency
	of REMD is thus achieved by including replica temperatures in which
	the frequency of transitions is higher than that at the temperature
	of interest. In tests of the expressions for the error in the estimator,

	agreement with the results both from kinetic models of REMD and from
	actual all-atom simulations of the folding of a peptide in water.

This approach includes applied constraints on property values from interproperty relationships, expected smooth trends of properties between related chemicals, and the impact of chemical similarities and differences. These constraints are simultaneously included in the evaluation of the raw experimental data to provide recommended values of constant properties and correlations for temperature-dependent properties. This paper will illustrate how this systems approach has been used to provide recommended property values in the DIPPR 801 evaluated database. In particular, a recent re-evaluation of the properties of the 1,n-alkanediol compounds in the DIPPR database, prompted by the availability of more recently measured critical temperatures and pressures of three members of this family, is used as an illustrative case study of this approach, and some of the newly recommended property values and temperature-dependent correlations for this family are provided. }

	conformational change when the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
	protease cleaves it free from the Pr55(Gag) polyprotein. This rearrangement
	is thought to facilitate the establishment of specific CA-CA interactions
	that are required for the formation of the mature viral core. Substitution
	of amino acids that are critical for this refolding of the N terminus
	is generally detrimental to virus replication and mature virion core
	morphology. Here, we identify a conserved threonine in simian immunodeficiency
	virus (SIV) CA, T(47)(CA), that is requisite for viral replication.
	Replacement of T(47)CA in the infectious viral clone SfVmac239 with
	amino acids with different hydrogen-bonding capabilities and analysis
	of the effects of these substitutions at key steps in the viral life
	cycle demonstrate that hydrogen bonding at this position is important
	for virus infectivity and virion release. In the HIV-based homology
	model of the mature SIV CA N terminus presented in this study, T(47)(CA)
	forms several hydrogen bonds with a proximal aspartate, D(50)(CA).
	This model, coupled with strong phenotypic similarities between viral
	substitution mutants of each of these two residues in all of the
	virological assays described herein, indicates that hydrogen bonding
	between T(47)(CA) and D(50)(CA) is likely required for viral replication.
	As hydrogen bonding between these two residues is present in HIV
	CA as well, this interaction presents a potential target for antiviral
	drug design. 0022-538X}

	for appearance of the simplest forms of autonomy in the context of
	lipid vesicles (more specifically, lipid-peptide vesicles) that enclose
	an autocatalytic/proto-metabolic reaction network. The problem is
	approached from a `bottom-up' perspective, in the sense that we try
	to show how relatively simple cell components/processes could engage
	in a far-from-equilibrium dynamics, staying in those conditions thanks
	to a rudimentary but effective control of the matter-energy flow
	through it. In this general scenario, basic autonomy and, together

	approach to computing the necessary force constants and property
	derivatives. Least-squares derived derivatives are compared with

	corrections are presented for the first-row hydrides CH4, NH3, H2O,

	results for these molecules, and the electric moments corrected for
	vibrational effects are in excellent agreement with experiment. Vibrational
	averaging is shown to be especially important for the polarizability
	anisotropy, and excellent agreement with experiment is obtained.

Here we consider the quantum mechanics of Drude oscillators interacting through the full Coulombic Hamiltonian for which the interaction energy does not have this defect. This protypical model for interactions between matter includes electrostatics, induction, and dispersion. Potential energy curves for rare-gas dimers are very closely matched by Drude correlation energies plus a single exponential function. The exact and accurate results presented here help to delineate between the basic properties of the physical model and the effects that arise from the dipole

Comparison with results from highly accurate ab initio potentials indicates good agreement. A complete potential for real fluids is obtained by combining the two-body potentials with a density-dependent term for three-body interactions. Vapor-liquid equilibria molecular simulation data for the new potentials are compared with the experiment, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the two- and three-body contributions. The combination of the two-body 10-8 Lennard-Jones/Mie potential and three-body term is a good overall choice for the noble gases.}

   abstract = "In spite of the recent advents in parallel algorithms and computer hardware, high-level calculation of vibrational spectra of large molecules is still an uphill task. To overcome this, significant effort has been devoted to the development of new algorithms based on fragmentation methods. The present work provides the details of an efficient and accurate procedure for computing the vibrational spectra of large clusters employing molecular tailoring approach (MTA). The errors in the Hessian matrix elements and dipole derivatives arising due to the approximation nature of MTA are reduced by grafting the corrections from a smaller basis set. The algorithm has been tested out for obtaining vibrational spectra of neutral and charged water clusters at M\u{o}ller-Plesset second order level of theory, and benchmarking them against the respective full calculation (FC) and/or experimental results. For (H2O)16 clusters, the estimated vibrational frequencies are found to differ by a maximum of 2 cm-1 with reference to the corresponding FC values. Unlike the FC, the MTA-based calculations including grafting procedure can be performed on a limited hardware, yet take a fraction of the FC time. The present methodology, thus, opens a possibility of the accurate estimation of the vibrational spectra of large molecular systems, which is otherwise impossible or formidable."

  abstract = {Our knowledge of the mechanisms and regulation of intestinal absorption
	of water-soluble vitamins under normal physiological conditions,
	and of the factors/conditions that affect and interfere with theses
	processes has been significantly expanded in recent years as a result
	of the availability of a host of valuable molecular/cellular tools.
	Although structurally and functionally unrelated, the water-soluble
	vitamins share the feature of being essential for normal cellular
	functions, growth and development, and that their deficiency leads
	to a variety of clinical abnormalities that range from anaemia to
	growth retardation and neurological disorders. Humans cannot synthesize
	water-soluble vitamins (with the exception of some endogenous synthesis
	of niacin) and must obtain these micronutrients from exogenous sources.
	Thus body homoeostasis of these micronutrients depends on their normal
	absorption in the intestine. Interference with absorption, which
	occurs in a variety of conditions (e.g. congenital defects in the
	digestive or absorptive system, intestinal disease/resection, drug
	interaction and chronic alcohol use), leads to the development of
	deficiency (and sub-optimal status) and results in clinical abnormalities.
	It is well established now that intestinal absorption of the water-soluble
	vitamins ascorbate, biotin, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine,
	riboflavin and thiamin is via specific carrier-mediated processes.
	These processes are regulated by a variety of factors and conditions,
	and the regulation involves transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional
	mechanisms. Also well recognized now is the fact that the large intestine
	possesses specific and efficient uptake systems to absorb a number
	of water-soluble vitamins that are synthesized by the normal microflora.
	This source may contribute to total body vitamin nutrition, and especially
	towards the cellular nutrition and health of the local colonocytes.
	The present review aims to outline our current understanding of the
	mechanisms involved in intestinal absorption of water-soluble vitamins,
	their regulation, the cell biology of the carriers involved and the
	factors that negatively affect these absorptive events. },

Interionic forces may then be taken to be central and a comparison between lattice dynamical models and interionic potential models becomes possible. In this paper attention is restricted to MgO, NaCl, LiF and \{KI\} for all of which (i) an isotropic (breathing) deformation can account for the difference C44-C12 and (ii) only the negative ion need be considered deformable. The interionic potential is assumed to consist of Coulombic and van der Waals terms, which are taken as known, and short range repulsive terms with an exponential dependence on separation. The constants in these repulsive terms are determined from the force constants of the lattice dynamical models. Satisfactory agreement with measured cohesive energies can be achieved only if the charge on the ions is very close to the electronic charge (2e in the case of MgO). This leads to a sacrifice in accuracy of the lattice dynamical models but this is shown to be small so that reasonable compatibility between the two sets of models is thus demonstrated. The interionic potentials are compared with those of other workers. "

The model is applied to NaBr, NaI and KBr for which C12 > C44 and it is appropriate to consider only the anisotropic deformations. The model parameters are determined entirely from macroscopic data. By assuming an exponential form for the repulsive part of the interionic potential the cohesive energy of the crystals may be determined from the interionic force constants. The cohesive energies are in surprisingly good agreement with experiment although the potential parameters differ considerably from those of other workers. While the dispersion curves obtained from the model are in markedly worse agreement with experiment than those from the standard breathing shell model it is shown that the potentials(in addition to giving good cohesive energies) result in a reasonably consistent dynamical model."

  pages = {232--239},
  abstract = {This paper discusses the concept that crystallinity is not an essential
	requirement for applying the techniques of X-ray crystal structure
	analysis. Assuming this to be true, the removal of crystallinity
	as a prerequisite for the techniques would allow the imaging of structures
	well beyond the present range of sizes accessible to X-ray crystallography.
	An example of an imageable structure could be a single small biological
	cell, containing perhaps 10(13)-10(14) Da. The proposed concept differs
	from the usual diffraction method of studying noncrystalline structure,
	i.e. small-angle scattering, in carrying out the diffraction experiment
	and subsequent processing as if the structure being studied were
	in fact the asymmetric unit of a crystal: i.e.: orienting the structure
	in all directions in the X-ray beam needed to explore its Fourier
	transform (F transform), and phasing and inverting the transform
	to obtain the electron-density image of the structure. The one actual
	difference from the crystal case is that the F transform is faint
	and also continuous, rather than displaying discrete intense Bragg
	spots. As a result, to get a readable pattern, the structure must
	be exposed to high levels of radiation. This last fact creates the
	principal limitation of the technique. With single air-dried biological
	cells at room temperature as diffracting specimens and soft X-rays
	in the wavelength range 18-32 Angstrom, patterns to date have not
	been observed beyond resolutions of 140-300 Angstrom before radiation
	damage has become evident. At this resolution, the technique nevertheless
	would lie on the same curve of resolution vs specimen size as do
	the existing major imaging techniques of X-ray crystallography, electron
	microscopy and light microscopy, falling directly between the latter
	two. Thus, X-ray diffractive imaging is not destroyed by the withdrawal
	of crystallinity but instead is shifted to a new size range of structures,
	which have hitherto been somewhat inaccessible to imaging. A method
	for phasing the diffraction pattern, based on the ability to sample
	the pattern more finely than in the case of the crystalline specimen,
	is giving good results in preliminary testing. The principal need
	at present is for better instrumentation for collecting the diffraction
	data, including the additional motions needed for collecting data:in
	three dimensions.}

Lewis acids include those that can form chalcogen (HSF and HSBr), pnicogen (H2PF and H2PBr), and tetrel (H3SiF and H3SiBr) bonds, as well as H-bonds and halogen bonds. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) of each Lewis acid is considered in a number of ways. Pictorial versions show broad regions of positive and negative MEP, on surfaces that vary with respect to either the value of the chosen isopotential, or their distance from the nuclei. Specific points are identified where the MEP reaches a maximum on a particular isodensity surface (Vs,max). The locations and values of Vs,max were evaluated on different isodensity surfaces, and compared to the stabilities of the various equilibrium geometries. As the chosen isodensity is decreased, and the MEP maxima drift away from the molecule, some points maintain their angular positions with respect to the molecule, whereas others undergo a reorientation. The lowering isodensity also causes some of the maxima to disappear. In general, there is a fairly good correlation between the energetic ordering of the equilibrium structures and the values of Vs,max. A number of possible Lewis acid sites on the heteroaromatic imidazole ring were also considered and presents some cautions about application of Vs,max as the principal criterion for predicting equilibrium geometries.},

  abstract = {The microscopic structure of molecularly thin fluid films confined
	between solid substrates with macroscopically curved surfaces is
	investigated by means of grand canonical ensemble Monte Carlo (GCEMC)
	simulations, in which the thermodynamic state of the film is determined
	by its chemical potential mu and temperature T. This situation is
	akin to experiments involving the surface forces apparatus (SFA)
	in which the film is confined between two crossed cylinders of macroscopic
	radius R. The key quantity measured directly in SFA experiments is
	the ``force per radius R,'' F(h)/R, exerted by the film on the curved
	surfaces. This ``solvation force'' can be related to the local stress
	T\_{zz}(h) normal to the {$\backslash$it locally} planar surfaces,
	where h is the shortest:distance between them. Because T\_{zz}(h)
	and the microscopic structure of the confined film can be computed
	by GCEMC, the relation between T\_{zz} and the macroscopically
	defined quantity F/R can be employed to interpret the dependence
	of the latter in terms of variations of the film's local microscopic
	structure with h. For a liquid-crystalline film it is shown that
	reorientational effects are distinctly manifest in T\_{zz}(h) but
	are reflected only weakly in F(h)/R and are therefore likely to be
	missed if the interpretation of SFA experiments is based solely upon
	the latter. Pseudo-experimental F(h)/R curves generated by GCEMC
	for a nematic liquid-crystalline film are in qualitative agreement
	with recent SFA data [M. Ruths, S. Steinberg, and J. N. Israelachvili,
	Langmuir 12, 6637 (1996)], which suggests that one may gain deeper
	insight into the microscopic structure of confined films through
	a decomposition of experimentally determined solvation forces F(h)/R
	into T\_{zz}(h) by inverting the integral relation linking the

	systems by revealing atomic structures of proteins, nucleic acids
	and their complexes, with much recent interest in very large assemblies
	like the ribosome. As crystals of such large assemblies often diffract
	weakly (resolution worse than 4 angstrom), we need methods that work
	at such low resolution. In macromolecular assemblies, some of the
	components may be known at high resolution, whereas others are unknown:
	current refinement methods fail as they require a high-resolution
	starting structure for the entire complex(1). Determining the structure
	of such complexes, which are often of key biological importance,
	should be possible in principle as the number of independent diffraction
	intensities at a resolution better than 5 angstrom generally exceeds
	the number of degrees of freedom. Here we introduce a method that
	adds specific information from known homologous structures but allows
	global and local deformations of these homology models. Our approach
	uses the observation that local protein structure tends to be conserved
	as sequence and function evolve. Cross-validation with R(free) (
	the free R-factor) determines the optimum deformation and influence
	of the homology model. For test cases at 3.5-5 angstrom resolution
	with known structures at high resolution, our method gives significant
	improvements over conventional refinement in the model as monitored
	by coordinate accuracy, the definition of secondary structure and
	the quality of electron density maps. For re-refinements of a representative
	set of 19 low-resolution crystal structures from the Protein Data
	Bank, we find similar improvements. Thus, a structure derived from
	low-resolution diffraction data can have quality similar to a high-resolution
	structure. Our method is applicable to the study of weakly diffracting
	crystals using X-ray micro-diffraction(2) as well as data from new
	X-ray light sources(3). Use of homology information is not restricted
	to X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy: as optical
	imaging advances to subnanometre resolution(4,5), it can use similar

	a molecular mechanics (MM) force field that accounts for the sizable
	electronic polarizability a of the water molecule. A considerable
	number of such polarizable water models has been suggested,in the
	past. Most of them agree that one should employ the experimental
	value alpha(exp) for the electronic polarizability and compute the
	induced dipole moment mu(i) through linear response from the electric
	field E at the position ro of the oxygen atom. However, several more
	recent models have suggested somewhat smaller values for alpha. Using
	a hybrid method that combines density functional theory for a selected
	water molecule with an MM description of its liquid water environment,
	here we show that the choice of alpha(exp) is solely correct if the
	induced dipole moment mu(i) is calculated from the average electric
	field < E > within the volume occupied by the given water molecule.
	Because of considerable field inhomogencities caused by the structured
	aqueous environment, the average field < E > is much smaller than
	the local spot check E(ro). However, as opposed to E(ro), the average
	field < E > cannot be easily calculated in MM-MD simulations. Therefore,
	in polarizable MM water models, one should calculate the induced
	dipole moment mu(i) from E(ro) through the reduced polarizability
	alpha e(ff) = 0.68 alpha(exp), which then effectively accounts for
	the inhomogeneities of the electric field within the volume of a

  abstract = {The shapes of the amide bands in the infrared (IR) spectra of proteins
	and peptides are caused by electrostatically coupled vibrations within

	A structural decoding of the amide bands has to resort to simplified
	models because the huge size of these macromolecules prevents the
	application of accurate quantum mechanical methods such as density
	functional theory (DFT). Previous models employed transition-dipole
	coupling methods that are of limited accuracy. Here we propose a
	concept for the computation of protein IR spectra, which describes
	the molecular mechanics (MM) of polypeptide backbones by a polarizable
	force field of ``type II{''}. By extending the concepts of conventional
	polarizable MM force fields, such a PMM/II approach employs field-dependent
	parameters not only for the electrostatic signatures of the molecular
	components but also for the local potentials modeling the stiffness
	of chemical bonds with respect to elongations, angle deformations,
	and torsions. Using a PMM/II force field, the IR spectra of the polypeptide
	backbone can be efficiently calculated from the time dependence of
	the backbone's dipole moment during a short (e.g., 100 ps) MD simulation
	by Fourier transformation. PMM/II parameters are derived for harmonic
	bonding potentials of amide groups in polypeptides from a series
	of DFT calculations on the model molecule N-methylacetamide (NMA)
	exposed to homogeneous external electric fields. The amide force
	constants are shown to vary by as much as 20\% for relevant field
	strengths. As a proof of principle, it is shown that the large solvatochromic
	effects observed in the IR spectra of NMA upon transfer from the
	gas phase into aqueous solution are not only excellently reproduced
	by DFT/MM simulations but are also nicely modeled by the PMM/II approach.
	The tasks remaining for a proof of practice are specified.},

	least-squares fits of inverse frequencies. ZPVE scaling factors were
	obtained from a comparison of the computed ZPVEs (derived from theoretically
	determined harmonic vibrational frequencies) with ZPVEs determined
	from experimental harmonic frequencies and anharmonicity corrections
	for a set of 39 molecules. Finally, scaling factors for theoretical

  abstract = {We present the Dynamic Charge Equilibration (DQEq) method for a self-consistent
	treatment of charge transfer in force field modeling, where atomic
	charges are designed to reproduce electrostatic potentials calculated
	quantum mechanically. Force fields coupled with DQEq allow charges
	to readjust as geometry changes in classical simulations, using appropriate
	algorithms for periodic boundary conditions. The full electrostatic
	energy functional is used to derive the corresponding forces and
	the second derivatives (hessian) for vibrational calculations. Using
	DQEq electrostatics, we develop a simple nonbond force field for
	simulation of silica molecular sieves, where nonelectrostatic interactions
	are described by two-body Morse stretch terms. Energy minimization
	calculations with the new force field yield accurate unit cell geometries
	for siliceous zeolites. Relative enthalpies with respect to quartz
	and third-law entropies calculated from harmonic vibrational analysis
	agree very well with available calorimetric data: calculated SiO2
	enthalpies relative to -quartz are within 2 kJ/mol and entropies
	at 298 K are within 3 J/mol K of the respective experimental values.
	Contributions from the zero point energy and vibrational degrees
	of freedom were found to be only about 1 kJ/mol for the free energy
	of mutual transformations between microporous silica polymorphs.
	The approach presented here can be applied to interfaces and other
	oxides as well and it is suitable for development of force fields
	for accurate modeling of geometry and energetics of microporous and
	mesoporous materials, while providing a realistic description of
	electrostatic fields near surfaces and inside pores of adsorbents

  pages = {4527--4534},
  abstract = {In this paper we study the evaporation of a drop on a rough polytetrafluoroethylene
	substrate. A water-ethanol binary drop of few millimetres size is
	evaporating in a controlled pressure environment. An experimental
	set up is built to investigate the influence of ethanol concentration
	and drop profile on the evaporation rate. The measurements were performed
	using an optical technique. This latter allows measurements of the
	dynamic contact angle, the drop volume and the base width as function
	of time. For pure substances (water, ethanol) the evaporation rate
	and the drop profile are found to have a monotonous evolution with
	time. For binary water-ethanol mixtures, three stages corresponding
	to different wetting behaviours are identified. The evaporation rate
	measurement indicates that the more volatile component evaporates
	entirely in the first stage while in the last stage the less volatile
	component is dominantly evaporating. The behaviour of the wetting
	angle is correlated with the volume of the drop and the ethanol concentration.
	It was clearly demonstrated that at high ethanol concentration (75\%)
	the wetting contact angle of the drop matches the behaviour of pure
	ethanol during the first stage and tends to follow the behaviour
	of pure water during the third stage. This suggests that, as the
	ethanol evaporates in the first stage it diffuses to the interface
	where it dictates the surface tension properties and hence the wetting
	contact angle. Towards the end of the droplet lifetime, the wetting
	contact angle jumps to join the behaviour of pure water. (C) 2003

The potential form allows stable scaling from a fully interacting exp-6 system to a non-interacting reference system for the direct computation of free energy differences or efficient particle growth simulations, particularly for high-density systems. Additional scaling parameters were introduced to overcome known endpoint effects, whereby reducing the potential to an ideal gas state can produce singularities in simulation averages or prohibit the sampling of close particle distances. The scaled potential is validated in several ways, using Hamiltonian thermodynamic integration, by comparison to vapour-liquid and solid-liquid coexistence free energies reported in the literature, and by the application of the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation. Forms of the scaled exp-6 potential for its implementation into molecular simulations and the thermodynamic integration methods are also developed. }

abstract = { Reducing internal strain energy in small molecules is critical for designing potent drugs. Quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) methods are often used to estimate these energies. In an effort to determine which methods offer an optimal balance in accuracy and performance, we have carried out torsion scan analyses on 62 fragments. We compared nine QM and four MM methods to reference energies calculated at a higher level of theory: CCSD(T)/CBS single point energies (coupled cluster with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations at the complete basis set limit) calculated on optimized geometries using MP2/6-311+G**. The results show that both the more recent MP2.X perturbation method as well as MP2/CBS perform quite well. In addition, combining a Hartree-Fock geometry optimization with a MP2/CBS single point energy calculation offers a fast and accurate compromise when dispersion is not a key energy component. Among MM methods, the OPLS3 force field accurately reproduces CCSD(T)/CBS torsion energies on more test cases than the MMFF94s or Amber12:EHT force fields, which struggle with aryl-amide and aryl-aryl torsions. Using experimental conformations from the Cambridge Structural Database, we highlight three example structures for which OPLS3 significantly overestimates the strain. The energies and conformations presented should enable scientists to estimate the expected error for the methods described and we hope will spur further research into QM and MM methods. }

	We have carried out molecular dynamics simulations on peptides consisting

	stability of the central domain at the atomic level. All three peptides
	show high helical stability on the timescale of the MD simulations.
	Deviations from alpha-helical structure in all the simulations arise
	mainly from the formation of long stretches of pi-helix. Interconversion
	between alpha-helical and pi-helical conformations occurs through
	insertion of water molecules into alpha-helical hydrogen bonds and
	subsequent formation of reverse turns. The alpha-helical structure
	is stabilized by electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between
	oppositely charged sidechains with i,i+4 spacings, while the pi-helix
	is stabilized by i,i+5 salt bridge interactions. Possible i,i+3 salt
	bridges are of minor importance. There is a strong preference for
	salt bridges with a Glu residue N-terminal to a basic sidechain as
	compared to the opposite orientation. In the double and triple repeat
	peptides, strong i,i+4 salt bridges exist between the last Glu residue
	of one repeat and the first Lys residue of the next. This demonstrates

	temperature of trapped biomolecular ions derivatized with a fluorescent
	dye. Previous measurements for different sequences of polyproline
	peptides demonstrated that quenching rates are related to conformations
	and their spatial fluctuations. This paper presents the results of
	extending these methods to study the conformational dynamics of larger
	biomolecules. Vancomycin peptide noncovalent complexes in the 1+
	charge state were studied as a function of temperature for different
	W-KAA peptide chiralities (L-LDD, D-LDD, L-DLL). Fluorescence-quenching
	rates, k(q), were found to be stereoselective for these different
	chiralities with relative magnitudes k(q)(L-LDD) > k(q)(D-LDD) >
	k(q)(L-DLL). The variation in fluorescent quenching resulting from
	switching the chirality of the single Trp residue was readily detectable.
	Molecular dynamics analysis of complexes formed by W-KAA (L-LDD)
	and W-KAA(L-DLL) indicates that increased flexibility in the (L-DLL)
	complex is correlated with reduced quenching rates. Fluorescence
	measurements were also performed for the Trp-cage protein comparing
	quenching rates in the 1+, 2+, and 3+ charge states for which k(q)(+)
	>> k(q)(2+) approximate to k(q)(3+). Measurements of a sequence including
	a single-point mutation infer the presence of a salt-bridge structure
	in the 1+ charge state and its absence in both the 2+ and 3+ states.
	Molecular dynamics structures of Trp-cage indicate that a salt bridge
	in the 1+ charge state produces more compact conformations leading
	to larger quenching rates based on the quenching mechanism. In both
	these experimental studies the fluorescence-quenching rates were
	consistent with changes in structure induced by either intermolecular
	or intramolecular interactions. (J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 2010, 21,

abstract = {Water displays a vast array of unique properties, known as water’s anomalies, whose origin remains subject to hot debate. Our aim in this article is to provide a unified microscopic physical picture of water’s anomalies in terms of locally favored structures, encompassing both thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies, which are often attributed to different origins. We first identify locally favored structures via a microscopic structural descriptor that measures local translational order and provide direct evidence that they have a hierarchical impact on the anomalies. At each state point, the strength of thermodynamic anomalies is directly proportional to the amount of locally favored structures, while the dynamic properties of each molecule depend on the local structure surrounding both itself and its nearest neighbors. To incorporate this, we develop a novel hierarchical two-state model. We show by extensive simulations of two popular water models that both thermodynamic and kinetic anomalies can be almost perfectly explained by the temperature and pressure dependence of these local and non-local versions of the same structural descriptor, respectively. Moreover, our scenario makes three unique predictions in supercooled water, setting it apart from other scenarios: (1) Presence of an “Arrhenius-to-Arrhenius” crossover upon cooling, as the origin of the apparent “fragile-to-strong” transition; (2) maximum of dynamic heterogeneity around 20 K below the Widom line and far above the glass transition; (3) violation of the Stokes-Einstein-Debye relation at $∼2 T_g$, rather than $1.2 T_g$ typical of normal glass-formers. These predictions are verified by recent measurement of water’s diffusion at very low temperatures (point 1) and discoveries from our extensive simulations (points 2-3). We suggest that the same scenario may generally apply to water-like anomalies in liquids tending to form locally favored structures, including not only other important tetrahedral liquids such as silicon, germanium, and silica, but also metallic and chalcogenide liquids.

	the free energy of hydration of 15 amino acid side chain analogs
	derived from recent versions of the OPLS-AA, CHARMM, and AMBER parameter
	sets in TIP3P water using thermodynamic integration. We achieve a
	high degree of statistical precision in our simulations, obtaining
	uncertainties for the free energy of hydration of 0.02-0.05 kcal/mol,
	which are in general an order of magnitude smaller than those found
	in other studies. Notably, this level of precision is comparable
	to that obtained in experimental hydration free energy measurements
	of the same molecules. Root mean square differences from experiment
	over the set of molecules examined using AMBER-, CHARMM-, and OPLS-AA-derived
	parameters were 1.35 kcal/mol, 1.31 kcal/mol, and 0.85 kcal/mol,
	respectively. Under the simulation conditions used, these force fields
	tend to uniformly underestimate solubility of all the side chain
	analogs. The relative free energies of hydration between amino acid
	side chain analogs were closer to experiment but still exhibited
	significant deviations. Although extensive computational resources
	may be needed for large numbers of molecules, sufficient computational

	it is impossible to conclusively identify a ``best'' method for calculating
	the free energy, as each of the three methods performs more efficiently
	than the others in at least one situation examined in these toy problems.
	Finally, sample problems of the insertion/deletion of both a Lennard-Jones
	particle and a much larger molecule in TIP3P water are examined by
	these three methods. In all tests of atomistic systems, free energies
	obtained with BAR have significantly lower bias and smaller variance
	than when using EXP or TI, especially when the overlap in phase space
	between end states is small. For example, BAR can extract as much
	information from multiple fast, far-from-equilibrium simulations
	as from fewer simulations near equilibrium, which EXP cannot. Although
	TI and sometimes even EXP can be somewhat more efficient in idealized
	toy problems, in the realistic atomistic situations tested in this

	in experimental hydration free energy measurements of the same molecules.
	We find that TIP3P-MOD, a model designed to give improved free energy
	of hydration for methane, gives uniformly the closest match to experiment;
	we also find that the ability to accurately model pure water properties
	does not necessarily predict ability to predict solute/solvent behavior.
	We also evaluate the free energies of a number of novel modifications
	of TIP3P designed as a proof of concept that it is possible to obtain
	much better solute/solvent free energetic behavior without substantially
	negatively affecting pure water properties. We decrease the average
	error to zero while reducing the root mean square error below that
	of any of the published water models, with measured liquid water
	properties remaining almost constant with respect to our perturbations.
	This demonstrates there is still both room for improvement within
	current fixed-charge biomolecular force fields and significant parameter

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias."

All conversions were fully automated from the originally prepared AMBER input files using a combination of the ParmEd and InterMol conversion programs. We find that the energy calculations for all molecular dynamics engines for this molecular set agree to better than 0.1 {\%} relative absolute energy for all energy components, and in most cases an order of magnitude better, when reasonable choices are made for different cutoff parameters. However, there are some surprising sources of statistically significant differences. Most importantly, different choices of Coulomb's constant between programs are one of the largest sources of discrepancies in energies. We discuss the measures required to get good agreement in the energies for equivalent starting configurations between the simulation programs, and the energy differences that occur when simulations are run with program-specific default simulation parameter values.

The different multi-site models are categorised in terms of bond rigidity/flexibility and polarization. The models are assessed for their ability to reproduce experimental values at conditions ranging from ambient to supercritical conditions. In general, three or four sites are sufficient to obtain reasonable results with the addition of more sites not consistently yielding improvements. The addition of bond flexibility, while improving agreement with experiment for such properties as phase coexistence, dielectric constants, viscosity and diffusion, does not appear to significantly improve the prediction of thermodynamic properties in general. For the supercritical heat capacities and thermal expansion coefficient the flexible TIP4P/2005f model yields less accurate values than its rigid TIP4P/2005 counterpart. In contrast, accounting for polarizability consistently results in improved agreement with experiment. For properties such as the isochoric heat capacity and thermal expansion coefficient, the polarizable \{MCYna\} model yields values that are in very close agreement with experimental data in the temperature range of 300-600 K. A quantitative ranking scheme is proposed and applied to ambient conditions. At or near ambient conditions, the overall ranking of models investigated is (iAMOEBA, MCYna) &gt; (BKd3, TIP4P/FQ, GCPM, BK3) &gt; (TIP4P/2005, SPC/Fw, SPC/E) &gt; (SPC, TIP4P/2005f, NvdE, TIP5P) &gt; (TIP4P, TIP3P) &gt; (MCY, MCYL).

  abstract = {Four methods for deriving partial atomic charges from the quantum
	chemical electrostatic potential (CHELP, CHELPG, Merz-Kollman, and
	RESP) have been compared and critically evaluated. It is shown the
	charges strongly depend on how and where the potential points are
	selected. Two alternative methods are suggested to avoid the arbitrariness
	in the point-selection schemes and van der Waals exclusion radii:
	CHELP-BOW, which also estimates the charges from the electrostatic
	potential, but with potential points that are Boltzmann-weighted
	after their occurrence in actual simulations using the energy function
	of the program in which the charges will be used, and CHELMO, which
	estimates the charges directly from the electrostatic multipole moments.
	Different criteria for the quality of the charges are discussed.
	The CHELMO method gives the best multipole moments for small and
	medium-sized polar systems, whereas the CHELP-BOW charges reproduce
	best the total interaction energy in actual simulations. Among the
	standard methods, the Merz-Kollman charges give the best moments
	and potentials, but they show an appreciable dependence on the orientation
	of the molecule. We have also examined the recent warning that charges
	derived by a least-squares fit to the electrostatic potential normally
	are not statistically valid. It is shown that no rank-deficiency
	problems are encountered for molecules with up to 84 atoms if the
	least-squares fit is performed using pseuOPTdoinverses calculated by
	singular value decomposition and if constraints are treated by elimination.

  abstract = {Various methods for deriving atomic partial charges from the quantum

	the sucrose molecule. We show that if no further information is used,
	the charges on some carbon atoms become large and charge patterns
	involving these atoms are badly determined and poorly transferable.
	Adding lone-pairs on the ether oxygen atoms or dividing the molecule
	into smaller fragments did not cure the instabilities. We develop
	a method, CHELP-BOW0, that restrains charges toward zero with different
	weights for different atoms. These harmonic restraints preserve the
	linear form of the least-squares equations, which are solved in a
	single step using singular-value decomposition. CHELP-BOW0 improves
	the chemical transferability of the charges compared to unrestrained
	methods, and slightly improves their conformational transferability.
	It introduces a modest degradation of the fit compared to unrestrained
	CHELP-BOW (mean average deviation of the potential 0.00016 vs. 0.00010
	a.u.). A second new method, CHELP-BOWC, avoids the need for restraints
	by including several conformations in the fit, weighting each according
	to its estimated energy in solution. CHELP-BOWC charges are more
	transferable than CHELP-BOW or CHELP-BOW0 charges to conformations
	not included in the training set. Restraints to zero charge do not
	further improve transferability of the CHELP-BOWC charges. We, therefore,
	recommend CHELP-BOW charges for rigid molecules and CHELP-BOWC charges
	for flexible molecules. (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc. 0192-8651}

abstract = {The prototypical hydrogen bond in water dimer and hydrogen bonds in the protonated water dimer, in other small molecules, in water cyclic clusters, and in ice, covering a wide range of bond strengths, are theoretically investigated by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, considering not only a standard generalized gradient approximation functional but also, for the water dimer, hybrid and van der Waals corrected functionals. We compute structural, energetic, and electrostatic (induced molecular dipole moments) properties. In particular, hydrogen bonds are characterized in terms of differential electron density distributions and profiles, and of the shifts of the centres of maximally localized Wannier functions. The information from the latter quantities can be conveyed to a single geometric bonding parameter that appears to be correlated with the Mayer bond order parameter and can be taken as an estimate of the covalent contribution to the hydrogen bond. By considering the water trimer, the cyclic water hexamer, and the hexagonal phase of ice, we also elucidate the importance of cooperative/anticooperative effects in hydrogen-bonding formation.}

  abstract = {The theoretical atomization energies of some 45 CxHyOz molecules present in the Active Thermochemical Tables compilation and of particular interest to the combustion chemistry community have been computed using five composite model chemistries as titled. The species contain between 1-8 "heavy" atoms, and a few are conformationally diverse with up to nine conformers. The enthalpies of formation at 0 and 298.15 K are then derived via the atomization method and compared against the recommended values. In general, there is very good agreement between our averaged computed values and those in the ATcT; those for 1,3-cyclopentadiene exceptionally differ considerably, and we show from isodesmic reactions that the true value for 1,3-cyclopentadiene is closer to 134 kJ mol-1 than the reported 101 kJ mol-1. If one is restricted to using a single method, statistical measures indicate that the best methods are in the rank order G3~ G4 > W1BD > CBS-APNO > CBS-QB3. The CBS-x methods do on average predict DeltafH0(298.15 K) within~5 kJ mol-1 but are prone to occasional lapses. There are statistical advantages to be gained from using a number of methods in tandem, and all possible combinations have been tested. We find that the average formation enthalpy coming from using CBS-APNO/G4, CBS-APNO/G3, and G3/G4 show lower mean signed and mean unsigned errors, and lower standard and root-mean-squared deviations, than any of these methods in isolation. Combining these methods also leads to the added benefit of providing an uncertainty rooted in the chemical species under investigation. In general, CBS-APNO and W1BD tend to underestimate the formation enthalpies of target species, whereas CBS-QB3, G3, and G4 have a tendency to overestimate the same. Thus, combining CBS-APNO with a G3/G4 combination leads to an improvement in all statistical measures of accuracy and precision, predicting the ATcT values to within 0.14 +/- 4.21 kJ mol-1, thus rivalling "chemical accuracy" (+/-4.184 kJ mol-1) without the excessive cost associated with higher-level methods such as W1BD.}

abstract = { Accurate thermochemical data for compounds containing C/H/N/O are required to underpin kinetics simulation and modeling of the reactions of these species in different environments. There is a dearth of experimental data so computational quantum chemistry has stepped in to fill this breach and to verify whether particular experiments are in need of revision. A number of composite model chemistries (CBS-QB3, CBS-APNO, G3, and G4) are used to compute theoretical atomization energies and hence enthalpies of formation at 0 and 298.15 K, and these are benchmarked against the best available compendium of values, the Active Thermochemical Tables or ATcT. In general the agreement is very good for some 28 species with the only discrepancy being for hydrazine. It is shown that, although individually the methods do not perform that well, collectively the mean unsigned error is <1.7 kJ mol-1; hence, this approach provides a useful tool to screen published values and validate new experimental results. Using multiple model chemistries does have some drawbacks but can produce good results even for challenging molecules like HOON and CN2O2. The results for these smaller validated molecules are then used as anchors for determining the formation enthalpies of larger species such as methylated hydrazines and diazenes, five- and six-membered heterocyclics via carefully chosen isodesmic working reactions with the aim of resolving some discrepancies in the literature and establishing a properly validated database. This expanded database could be useful in testing the performance of computationally less-demanding density function methods with newer functionals that have the capacity to treat much larger systems than those tested here. }

  abstract = {The all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS-AA)
	force field is a popular force field for simulating biomolecules.
	However, the current OPLS parameters for hydrocarbons developed using
	short alkanes cannot reproduce the liquid properties of long alkanes
	in molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, the extension of OPLS-AA
	to (phospho)lipid molecules required for the study of biological
	membranes was hampered in the past. Here, we optimized the OPLS-AA
	force field for both short and long hydrocarbons. Following the framework
	of the OPLS-AA parametrization, we refined the torsional parameters
	for hydrocarbons by fitting to the gas-phase ab initio energy profiles
	calculated at the accurate MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ theory level. Additionally,
	the depth of the Lennard-Jones potential for methylene hydrogen atoms
	was adjusted to reproduce the densities and the heats of vaporization
	of alkanes and alkenes of different lengths. Optimization of partial
	charges finally allowed to reproduce the gel-to-liquid-phase transition
	temperature for pentadecane and solvation free energies. It is shown
	that the optimized parameter set (L-OPLS) yields improved hydrocarbon
	diffusion coefficients, viscosities, and gauche-trans ratios. Moreover,
	its applicability for lipid bilayer simulations is shown for a GMO
	bilayer in its liquid-crystalline phase.},

	Damping is necessary to obtain the correct asymptotic short-range
	behavior of these interactions. Correctly chosen damping functions
	allow a balanced description of different parts of intermolecular
	potential energy surfaces and improve the accuracy of predicted intermolecular
	distances and binding energies. The performance of different damping
	functions is tested by comparing the EFP energy terms with the symmetry
	adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) energy terms in a range of intermolecular
	separations for ten molecular dimers. The total EFP binding energies
	in these dimers were compared with the binding energies obtained
	from SAPT and coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative
	triple excitations {[}CCSD(T)]. A formula for electrostatic damping
	that was derived from first principles is recommended. This method
	employs the overlap of fragment localized molecular orbitals (LMO)
	within the spherical Gaussian approximation. The LMO overlap integrals
	are also used to determine the damping of dispersion. Gaussian polarization
	damping functions are recommended for use within the EFP framework.
	With this set of damping functions, the EFP binding energies are
	within 0.5 kcal/mol and intermolecular equilibrium separations are
	within 0.2 angstrom of the corresponding CCSD(T) and SAPT values.
	This consistent accuracy of EFP is encouraging for future studies

abstract ={Water challenges our fundamental understanding of emergent materials properties from a molecular perspective. It exhibits a uniquely rich phenomenology including dramatic variations in behavior over the wide temperature range of the liquid into water's crystalline phases and amorphous states. We show that many-body responses arising from water's electronic structure are essential mechanisms harnessed by the molecule to encode for the distinguishing features of its condensed states. We treat the complete set of these many-body responses nonperturbatively within a coarse-grained electronic structure derived exclusively from single-molecule properties. Such a "strong coupling" approach generates interaction terms of all symmetries to all orders, thereby enabling unique transferability to diverse local environments such as those encountered along the coexistence curve. The symmetries of local motifs that can potentially emerge are not known a priori. Consequently, electronic responses unfiltered by artificial truncation are then required to embody the terms that tip the balance to the correct set of structures. Therefore, our fully responsive molecular model produces, a simple, accurate, and intuitive picture of water's complexity and its molecular origin, predicting water's signature physical properties from ice, through liquid-vapor coexistence, to the critical point.},

Pages = {{825-842}},
Abstract = {{Observations of methane, CFC-11, and ozone losses are used along with
   insights from models and observations regarding interrelationships
   between tracers to develop a semi-empirical framework for evaluating
   global ozone depletion potentials. Direct measurements of some
   hydrochlorofluorocarbons including HCFC-22 in the Arctic lower
   stratosphere are also used to evaluate the local ozone depletion
   potentials there. This approach assumes that all of the observed ozone
   destruction in the contemporary atmosphere is due to chlorine and that
   the depletion is proportional to the local relative chlorine release. It
   is shown that the global ozone depletion potentials for compounds with
   relatively long stratospheric lifetimes such as HCFC-22 and HCFC-142b
   are likely to be larger than those generally predicted by gas phase
   chemical models, due largely to the importance of lower stratospheric
   ozone losses that are not simulated in gas phase studies. The analysis
   presented suggests that the globally averaged efficiency for ozone
   depletion by HCFC-22 is as much as a factor of 2 larger than some gas
   phase model estimates. For compounds with short stratospheric lifetimes
   such as CCl4 and CH3CCl3, on the other hand, gas phase models likely
   overestimates the ozone depletion potentials for the present-day
   stratosphere. Observations of polar ozone loss and reactive halogen
   radical abundances also imply that the globally averaged ozone depletion
   potentials for brominated species for the contemporary stratosphere
   could be as much as 1.5-3 times greater than some gas phase model
   predictions, depending upon lower stratospheric loss processes.}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{374}},
Pages = {{1179-1185}},
Abstract = {{Background 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has a long
   half-life of 5-10 years in human beings as a result of its high
   lipophilicity, and little or no metabolism. We monitored TCDD, its form,
   distribution, and elimination in Victor Yushchenko after he presented
   with severe poisoning.
   Methods In late December, 2004, a patient presented with TCDD poisoning;
   the levels in his blood serum (108000 pg/g lipid weight) were more than
   50000-fold greater than those in the general population. We identified
   TCDD and its metabolites, and monitored their levels for 3 years using
   gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry in samples of
   blood serum, adipose tissue, faeces, skin, urine, and sweat, after they
   were extracted and cleaned with different organic solvents.
   Findings The amount of unmodified TCDD in the samples that were analysed
   accounted for about 60\% of TCDD eliminated from the body during the
   same period. Two TCDD
   metabolites-2,3,7-trichloro-8-hydroxydibenzo-p-dioxin and
   1,3,7,8-tetrachloro-2-hydroxydibenzo-p-dioxin-were identified in the
   faeces, blood serum, and urine. The faeces contained the highest
   concentration of TCDD metabolites, and were the main route of
   elimination. Altogether, the different routes of elimination of TCDD and
   its metabolites accounted for 98\% of the loss of the toxin from the
   body. The half-life of TCDD in our patient was 15.4 months.
   Interpretation This case of poisoning with TCDD suggests that the design
   of methods for routine assessment of TCDD metabolites in human beings
   should be a main aim of TCDD research in the metabolomic era.

	preferences}},
  journal = BTjmb,
  year = {2006},
  volume = {356},
  pages = {248--256},
  abstract = {The 21 residue polyalanine-based F-s peptide was studied using thousands
	of long, explicit solvent, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations
	that reached equilibrium at the ensemble level. Peptide conformational
	preference as a function of hydrophobicity was examined using a spectrum
	of explicit solvent models, and the peptide length-dependence of
	the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components of solvent-accessible
	surface area for several ideal conformational types was considered.
	Our results demonstrate how the character of the solvation interface
	induces several conformational preferences, including a decrease
	in mean helical content with increased hydrophilicity, which occurs
	predominantly through reduced nucleation tendency and, to a lesser
	extent, destabilization of helical propagation. Interestingly, an
	opposing effect occurs through increased propensity for 3(10)-helix
	conformations, as well as increased polyproline structure. Our observations
	provide a framework for understanding previous reports of conformational
	preferences in polyalanine-based peptides including (i) terminal
	3(10)-helix prominence, (ii) low pi-helix propensity, (iii) increased
	polyproline conformations in short and unfolded peptides, and (iv)
	membrane helix stability in the presence and absence of water. These
	observations provide physical insight into the role of water in peptide
	conformational equilibria at the atomic level, and expand our view
	of the complexity of even the most ``simple'' of biopolymers. Whereas
	previous studies have focused predominantly on hydrophobic effects
	with respect to tertiary structure, this work highlights the need
	for consideration of such effects at the secondary structural level.

abstract = {Coupled cluster calculations with all single and double excitations (CCSD) converge exceedingly slowly with the size of the one-particle basis set. We assess the performance of a number of approaches for obtaining CCSD correlation energies close to the complete basis-set limit in conjunction with relatively small DZ and TZ basis sets. These include global and system-dependent extrapolations based on the A + B/Lα two-point extrapolation formula, and the well-known additivity approach that uses an MP2-based basis-set-correction term. We show that the basis set convergence rate can change dramatically between different systems(e.g.it is slower for molecules with polar bonds and/or second-row elements). The system-dependent basis-set extrapolation scheme, in which unique basis-set extrapolation exponents for each system are obtained from lower-cost MP2 calculations, significantly accelerates the basis-set convergence relative to the global extrapolations. Nevertheless, we find that the simple MP2-based basis-set additivity scheme outperforms the extrapolation approaches. For example, the following root-mean-squared deviations are obtained for the 140 basis-set limit CCSD atomization energies in the W4-11 database: 9.1 (global extrapolation), 3.7 (system-dependent extrapolation), and 2.4 (additivity scheme) kJ mol-1. The CCSD energy in these approximations is obtained from basis sets of up to TZ quality and the latter two approaches require additional MP2 calculations with basis sets of up to QZ quality. We also assess the performance of the basis-set extrapolations and additivity schemes for a set of 20 basis-set limit CCSD atomization energies of larger molecules including amino acids, DNA/RNA bases, aromatic compounds, and platonic hydrocarbon cages. We obtain the following RMSDs for the above methods: 10.2 (global extrapolation), 5.7 (system-dependent extrapolation), and 2.9 (additivity scheme) kJ mol-1.}

   abstract = "We examine the basis set convergence of the CCSD(T) method for obtaining the structures of the 108 neutral first- and second-row species in the W4-11 database (with up to five non-hydrogen atoms). This set includes a total of 181 unique bonds: 75 H—X, 49 X—Y, 43 X=Y, and 14 X≡Y bonds (where X and Y are first- and second-row atoms). As reference values, geometries optimized at the CCSD(T)/aug′-cc-pV(6+d)Z level of theory are used. We consider the basis set convergence of the CCSD(T) method with the correlation consistent basis sets cc-pV(n+d)Z and aug′-cc-pV(n+d)Z (n = D, T, Q, 5) and the Weigend-Ahlrichs def2-n ZVPP basis sets (n = T, Q). For each increase in the highest angular momentum present in the basis set, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) over the bond distances is decreased by a factor of ∼4. For example, the following RMSDs are obtained for the cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets 0.0196 (D), 0.0050 (T), 0.0015 (Q), and 0.0004 (5) Å. Similar results are obtained for the aug′-cc-pV(n+d)Z and def2-n ZVPP basis sets. The double-zeta and triple-zeta quality basis sets systematically and significantly overestimate the bond distances. A simple and cost-effective way to improve the performance of these basis sets is to scale the bond distances by an empirical scaling factor of 0.9865 (cc-pV(D+d)Z) and 0.9969 (cc-pV(T+d)Z). This results in RMSDs of 0.0080 (scaled cc-pV(D+d)Z) and 0.0029 (scaled cc-pV(T+d)Z) Å. The basis set convergence of larger basis sets can be accelerated via standard basis-set extrapolations. In addition, the basis set convergence of explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12 calculations is investigated in conjunction with the cc-pVnZ-F12 basis sets (n = D, T). Typically, one “gains” two angular momenta in the explicitly correlated calculations. That is, the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVnZ-F12 level of theory shows similar performance to the CCSD(T)/cc-pV(n+2)Z level of theory. In particular, the following RMSDs are obtained for the cc-pVnZ-F12 basis sets 0.0019 (D) and 0.0006 (T) Å. Overall, the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12 level of theory offers a stellar price-performance ratio and we recommend using it when highly accurate reference geometries are needed (e.g., in composite ab initio theories such as W4 and HEAT)."

	(VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and two calcium ions, was solvated both
	on the exterior and the interior to fill the inside of the capsid.
	The stability of the simulations of this large system (similar to
	800 residues and 6,650 water molecules) is comparable to more conventional
	globular protein simulations. The influence of the antiviral compound
	on compressibility and positional fluctuations is reported. The compressibility,
	estimated from the density fluctuations in the region of the binding
	pocket, was found to be greater with WIN 52084s bound than without
	the drug, substantiating previous computations on reduced viral systems.
	An increase in compressibility correlates with an entropically more
	favorable system. In contrast to the increase in density fluctuations
	and compressibility, the positional fluctuations decreased dramatically
	for the external loops of VPI and the N-terminus of VP3 when WIN
	52084s is bound. Most of these VPI and VP3 loops are found near the
	fivefold axis, a region whose mobility was not considered in reduced
	systems, but can be observed with this simulation of the full viral
	protomer. Altered loop flexibility is consistent with changes in
	proteolytic sensitivity observed experimentally. Moreover, decreased
	flexibility in these intraprotomeric loops is noteworthy since the
	externalization of VP4, part of VP1, and RNA during the uncoating
	process is thought to involve areas near the fivefold axis. Both
	the decrease in positional fluctuations at the fivefold axis and

  abstract = {Background: There is a need for software applications that provide
	users with a complete and extensible toolkit for chemo- and bioinformatics
	accessible from a single workbench. Commercial packages are expensive
	and closed source, hence they do not allow end users to modify algorithms
	and add custom functionality. Existing open source projects are more
	focused on providing a framework for integrating existing, separately
	installed bioinformatics packages, rather than providing user-friendly
	interfaces. No open source chemoinformatics workbench has previously
	been published, and no sucessful attempts have been made to integrate
	chemo- and bioinformatics into a single framework. Results: Bioclipse
	is an advanced workbench for resources in chemo- and bioinformatics,
	such as molecules, proteins, sequences, spectra, and scripts. It
	provides 2D-editing, 3D-visualization, file format conversion, calculation
	of chemical properties, and much more; all fully integrated into
	a user-friendly desktop application. Editing supports standard functions
	such as cut and paste, drag and drop, and undo/redo. Bioclipse is
	written in Java and based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform with
	a state-of-the-art plugin architecture. This gives Bioclipse an advantage
	over other systems as it can easily be extended with functionality
	in any desired direction. Conclusion: Bioclipse is a powerful workbench
	for bio- and chemoinformatics as well as an advanced integration
	platform. The rich functionality, intuitive user interface, and powerful
	plugin architecture make Bioclipse the most advanced and user-friendly
	open source workbench for chemo- and bioinformatics. Bioclipse is
	released under Eclipse Public License (EPL), an open source license
	which sets no constraints on external plugin licensing; it is totally
	open for both open source plugins as well as commercial ones. Bioclipse
	is freely available at http://www.bioclipse.net.},

  abstract = {Most biomolecular force fields are well-suited for studying static
	properties of equilibrium structures; however, they have hardly been
	tested on very-long-time dynamics. This is an important area of research,
	because computers shortly will be fast enough for quantitative computational
	studies of folding and stability of small protein domains. in this
	work, we present an extensive series of 28 50-ns particle-mesh Ewald
	simulations (a total of 1.4 mus of data) of the Villin headpiece
	in water, to compare the results of the OPLS-AA/L and GROMOS96 force
	fields, the influence of water models, protonation states, and the
	effect of using virtual ``dummy'' particles for H atoms to increase
	the simulation time step. in addition to normal properties such as
	the Calpha root-mean-square deviation, hydrogen bonding, and secondary
	structure, we also calculate the NMR distance restraints, J-couplings,
	and chemical shifts of Villin from the simulation and compare directly
	with the experimental data. We argue that this comparison of simulated
	and experimental ensembles of structures is a much more accurate
	tool than the classical comparison of average or momentaneous protein
	structures. for the Villin system simulated, we find that distance
	restraint violations in the simulations are comparable to, or even
	lower than, those from the ensemble obtained by distance geometry.
	Furthermore, we find that the OPLS-AA/L force field works considerably
	better with the TIP4P water model than with the simple point charge
	model. in further simulations, we have tested the effect of the protonation
	state of the two Glutamate residues, because the structure was determined
	at pH 3.7. We do find slightly better agreement of the simulations
	with experimental data when the Glutamate residues are protonated.
	Finally, we have used multiple different starting structures for
	most simulations and find that the results are very similar.},

  abstract = {Evidence from mass-spectrometry experiments and molecular dynamics
	simulations suggests that it is possible to transfer proteins, or
	in general biomolecular aggregates, from solution to the gas-phase
	without grave impact on the structure. If correct, this allows interpretation
	of such experiments as a probe of physiological behavior. Here, we
	survey recent experimental results from mass spectrometry and ion-mobility
	spectroscopy and combine this with observations based on molecular
	dynamics simulation, in order to give a comprehensive overview of
	the state of the art in gas-phase studies. We introduce a new concept
	in protein structure analysis by determining the fraction of the
	theoretical possible numbers of hydrogen bonds that are formed in
	solution and in the gas-phase. In solution on average 43\% of the
	hydrogen bonds is realized, while in vacuo this fraction increases
	to 56\%. The hydrogen bonds stabilizing the secondary structure (alpha-helices,
	beta-sheets) are maintained to a large degree, with additional hydrogen
	bonds occurring when side chains make new hydrogen bonds to rest
	of the protein rather than to solvent. This indicates that proteins
	that are transported to the gas phase in a native-like manner in
	many cases will be kinetically trapped in near-physiological structures.
	Simulation results for lipid-and detergent-aggregates and lipid-coated
	(membrane) proteins in the gas phase are discussed, which in general
	point to the conclusion that encapsulating proteins in ``something''
	aids in the conservation of native-like structure. Isolated solvated
	micelles of cetyl-tetraammonium bromide quickly turn into reverse
	micelles whereas dodecyl phosphocholine micelles undergo much slower
	conversions, and do not quite reach a reverse micelle conformation

	the removal of nonpolar surface makes the dominant contribution to
	the standard heat capacity change of folding (DELTA-C(fold)o), here
	we show that inclusion of the contribution from removal of polar
	surface allows a quantitative prediction of DELTA-C(fold)o within
	the uncertainty of the calorimetrically determined value. Moreover,
	analysis of the contribution of polar surface area to the enthalpy
	of transfer of liquid amides provides a means of estimating the contributions
	from changes in nonpolar and polar surface area as well as other
	factors to the enthalpy of folding (DELTA-H(fold)o). In addition
	to estimates of DELTA-H(fold)o, this extension of the liquid hydrocarbon
	model provides a thermodynamic explanation for the observation {[}Privalov,
	P. L., \& Khechinashvili, N. N. (1974) J. Mol. Biol. 86, 665-684]
	that the specific enthalpy of folding (cal g-1) of a number of globular
	proteins converges to a common value at approximately 383 K. Because
	amounts of nonpolar and polar surface area buried by these proteins
	upon folding are found to be linear functions of molar mass, estimates
	of both DELTA-C(fold)o and DELTA-H(fold)o may be obtained given only
	the molar mass of the protein of interest. Use of DELTA-C(fold)o
	and DELTA-H(fold)o in conjunction with a melting temperature (T(m))
	determined under specified solution conditions allows one to estimate
	the stability (DELTA-G(fold)o) under these conditions at any temperature.
	Calculated values of DELTA-G(fold)o in the range 293-320 K appear
	generally to agree with those determined by calorimetric and noncalorimetric
	methods. This analysis should provide a basis for predicting the
	stability of proteins whose structural and thermodynamic properties
	are similar to those in the data set used for this analysis. Deviations
	from these predictions may be interpretable in terms of deviations
	from the average properties of the proteins in the data set.},

	equation method for both the gas-phase and surface chemistry. The
	results of the different models are in agreement for the abundances
	of the gaseous species except for later times when the surface chemistry
	begins to affect the gas. The agreement for the surface species,
	however, is somewhat mixed. The average abundances of highly reactive
	surface species can be orders of magnitude larger in the stochastic-deterministic
	model than in the purely deterministic one. For non-reactive species,
	the results of the models can disagree strongly at early times, but
	agree to well within an order of magnitude at later times for most
	molecules. Strong exceptions occur for CO and H2CO at 10 K, and for
	CO2 at 20 K. The agreement seems to be best at a temperature of 15
	K. As opposed to the use of the normal rate equation method of surface
	chemistry, the modified rate method is in significantly better agreement
	with the stochastic-deterministic approach. Comparison with observations
	of molecular ices in dense clouds shows mixed agreement.}

Abstract = {{The fraudulent treatment of cattle with growth promoting agents (GPAs)
   is a matter of great concern for the European Union (EU) authorities and

   illegally treated in the EU. In contrast, only a much lower percentage
   of animals (< 0.5\%) are actually found as being noncompliant by
   conventional analytical methods. Thus, it has been proposed that methods
   should be developed that can detect the use of the substances via the
   biological effects of these substances on target organs, such as the
   alteration of protein expression profiles. Here we present a study aimed
   at evaluating if a correlation exists between the treatment with GPAs
   and alterations in the two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) protein
   pattern obtained from the biceps brachii skeletal muscle from mixed-bred
   cattle. After image analysis and statistical evaluation, protein spots
   that differentiate between treated and control groups were selected for
   analysis by mass spectrometry. A set of proteins could be defined that
   accurately detect the use of glucocorticoids and beta(2)-agonists as
   growth promoters through the changes caused in muscle differentiation.

Abstract = {{We carry out molecular-dynamics simulations of the water-NaCl 100 interface. 
The study includes the bulk interface at T􏱍298K and thin physisorbed films for coverages ranging 
from 0 to 1.5 at T􏱍140K. We use an efficient SPC/E based fluctuating charge water model to 
account for polarization effects. The water model is tested calculating cluster, gas, and liquid 
phase properties of neat water as well as structural and dynamic properties of solutions containing 
Na, Cl, and Ca2 ions. For the bulk water-NaCl 100 system we analyze the surface induced hydration 
shell structure as well as residence times and the dipole orientation autocorrelation near the surface. 
At the low temperature we calculate the coverage dependence of the isosteric heat of adsorption, 
which is compared to available experimental data, including the coverage dependence of the adsorbate 
structure and dynamics. We note that our simulations support the formation of the
1*1 superstructure seen in helium scattering experiments.}},

  abstract = {Here we report the effect of a heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (HAP) antiviral
	compound, BAY 41-4109, on Hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid assembly
	and on preformed HBV capsids. The HBV capsid is an icosahedral complex
	of 120 capsid protein dimers. BAY41-4109 inhibits virus production
	in vivo by a mechanism that targets the viral capsid. We found that
	BAY 41-4109 was able to both accelerate and misdirect capsid assembly
	in vitro. As little as one HAP molecule for every five HBV dimers
	was sufficient to induce formation of non-capsid polymers. Unlike
	the related molecule HAP-1 (Stray et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
	USA 102:813843, 2005), no stable assembly intermediates were observed
	in assembly reactions with BAY 41-4109, indicating that accelerated
	assembly by BAY 41-4109 was still kinetically regulated by the nucleation
	rate. Preformed capsids were stabilized by BAY 41-4109, up to a ratio
	of one inhibitor molecule per two dimers. However, at BAY 41-4109:dimer
	ratios of 1:1 and greater, capsids were destabilized to yield very
	large noncapsid polymers. These data suggest the existence of two
	functionally distinguishable classes of drug-binding sites on HBV
	capsids. Occupation of the first class of site stabilizes capsid,
	while binding at the second class requires or induces structural
	changes that cannot be tolerated without destabilizing the capsid.
	Our data suggest that HAP compounds may inhibit virus replication
	by inducing assembly inappropriately and, when in excess, by misdirecting
	assembly decreasing the stability of normal capsids. Copyright (c)

abstract = { As shown by previous theoretical and computational work, absolute entropies of small molecules that populate different conformers can be predicted accurately on the basis of the partitioning of the intramolecular entropy into vibrational and conformational contributions. Herein, we further elaborate on this idea and propose a protocol for entropy calculations of single molecules that combines the rigid rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) entropies with the direct sampling of the molecular conformational space by means of classical molecular dynamics simulations. In this approach, the conformational states are characterized by discretizing the time evolution of internal rotations about single bonds, and subsequently, the mutual information expansion (MIE) is used to approach the full conformational entropy from the converged probability density functions of the individual torsion angles, pairs of torsions, triads, and so on. This RRHO\&MIE protocol could have broad applicability, as suggested by our test calculations on systems ranging from hydrocarbon molecules in the gas phase to a polypeptide molecule in aqueous solution. For the hydrocarbon molecules, the ability of the RRHO\&MIE protocol to predict absolute entropies is assessed by carefully comparing theoretical and experimental values in the gas phase. For the rest of the test systems, we analyze the advantages and limitations of the RRHO\&MIE approach in order to capture high order correlation effects and yield converged conformational entropies within a reasonable simulation time. Altogether, our results suggest that the RRHO\&MIE strategy could be useful for estimating absolute and/or relative entropies of single molecules either in the gas phase or in solution. }

	In our earlier work, it was reported that the structure of methane

	range (y(CH4)) of 0.72-0.75. In this work, Raman spectroscopic measurements

	sII to sI over a y(CH4) range of 0.992 (+/- 0.005)-0.994 (+/- 0.007).
	C-13 NMR measurements on this system suggest that the methane hydrate
	composition increases by at least 0.2 mole fraction at the lower

	structure above the incipient hydrate formation conditions may be

  abstract = {The oceanic cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus are globally important,
	ecologically diverse primary producers. It is thought that their
	viruses ( phages) mediate population sizes and affect the evolutionary
	trajectories of their hosts. Here we present an analysis of genomes
	from three Prochlorococcus phages: a podovirus and two myoviruses.
	The morphology, overall genome features, and gene content of these
	phages suggest that they are quite similar to T7-like (P-SSP7) and
	T4-like (P-SSM2 and P-SSM4) phages. Using the existing phage taxonomic
	framework as a guideline, we examined genome sequences to establish
	``core'' genes for each phage group. We found the podovirus contained
	15 of 26 core T7-like genes and the two myoviruses contained 43 and
	42 of 75 core T4-like genes. In addition to these core genes, each
	genome contains a significant number of ``cyanobacterial'' genes,
	i.e., genes with significant best BLAST hits to genes found in cyanobacteria.
	Some of these, we speculate, represent ``signature'' cyanophage genes.
	For example, all three phage genomes contain photosynthetic genes
	( psbA, hliP) that are thought to help maintain host photosynthetic
	activity during infection, as well as an aldolase family gene (talC)
	that could facilitate alternative routes of carbon metabolism during
	infection. The podovirus genome also contains an integrase gene (int)
	and other features that suggest it is capable of integrating into
	its host. If indeed it is, this would be unprecedented among cultured
	T7-like phages or marine cyanophages and would have significant evolutionary
	and ecological implications for phage and host. Further, both myoviruses
	contain phosphate-inducible genes ( phoH and pstS) that are likely
	to be important for phage and host responses to phosphate stress,
	a commonly limiting nutrient in marine systems. Thus, these marine
	cyanophages appear to be variations of two well-known phages - T7
	and T4 - but contain genes that, if functional, reflect adaptations
	for infection of photosynthetic hosts in low-nutrient oceanic environments.},

  abstract = {Cyanophages ( cyanobacterial viruses) are important agents of horizontal
	gene transfer among marine cyanobacteria, the numerically dominant
	photosynthetic organisms in the oceans. Some cyanophage genomes carry
	and express host-like photosynthesis genes, presumably to augment
	the host photosynthetic machinery during infection. To study the
	prevalence and evolutionary dynamics of this phenomenon, 33 cultured
	cyanophages of known family and host range and viral DNA from field
	samples were screened for the presence of two core photosystem reaction
	center genes, psbA and psbD. Combining this expanded dataset with
	published data for nine other cyanophages, we found that 88\% of
	the phage genomes contain psbA, and 50\% contain both psbA and psbD.
	The psbA gene was found in all myoviruses and Prochlorococcus podoviruses,
	but could not be amplified from Prochlorococcus siphoviruses or Synechococcus
	podoviruses. Nearly all of the phages that encoded both psbA and
	psbD had broad host ranges. We speculate that the presence or absence
	of psbA in a phage genome may be determined by the length of the
	latent period of infection. Whether it also carries psbD may reflect
	constraints on coupling of viral- and host-encoded PsbA-PsbD in the
	photosynthetic reaction center across divergent hosts. Phylogenetic
	clustering patterns of these genes from cultured phages suggest that
	whole genes have been transferred from host to phage in a discrete
	number of events over the course of evolution ( four for psbA, and
	two for psbD), followed by horizontal and vertical transfer between
	cyanophages. Clustering patterns of psbA and psbD from Synechococcus
	cells were inconsistent with other molecular phylogenetic markers,
	suggesting genetic exchanges involving Synechococcus lineages. Signatures
	of intragenic recombination, detected within the cyanophage gene
	pool as well as between hosts and phages in both directions, support
	this hypothesis. The analysis of cyanophage psbA and psbD genes from
	field populations revealed significant sequence diversity, much of
	which is represented in our cultured isolates. Collectively, these
	findings show that photosynthesis genes are common in cyanophages
	and that significant genetic exchanges occur from host to phage,
	phage to host, and within the phage gene pool. This generates genetic
	diversity among the phage, which serves as a reservoir for their
	hosts, and in turn influences photosystem evolution.},

	anions (Cl-, Br-, I-) at the water surface is of great importance

	at the surface attract water molecules more strongly. Of relevance
	is also the ordering of the surface water molecules with their hydrogen
	atoms pointing outwards which induce an external electronic field
	that leads to different surface behavior of anions and cations. The

To validate the force field, the prediction results from the VDW FF were compared with standard FFs, such as UFF, Dreiding, Pcff, and Compass. The results from the VDW FF were in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements.

Phys. 119, 11792-11805 (2003)] provides a promising paradigm to efficiently determine the ionic entropies of liquids from molecular dynamics. In this model, the vibrational density of states (VDoS) of a liquid is decomposed into a diffusive gas-like component and a vibrational solid-like component. By treating the diffusive component as hard sphere (HS) gas and the vibrational component as harmonic oscillators, the ionic entropy of the liquid is determined. Here we examine three issues crucial for practical implementations of the 2PT model: (i) the mismatch between the VDoS of the liquid system and that of the HS gas; (ii) the excess entropy of the HS gas; (iii) the partition of the gas-like and solid-like components. Some of these issues have not been addressed before, yet they profoundly change the entropy predicted from the model. Based on these findings, a revised 2PT formalism is proposed and successfully tested in systems with Lennard-Jones potentials as well as many-atom potentials of liquid metals. Aside from being capable of performing quick entropy estimations for a wide range of systems, the formalism also supports fine-tuning to accurately determine entropies at specific thermal states.}

PAC-MAC is a force field based quasi-chemical method for predicting miscibility properties of various binary mixtures. The TI calculations yield a root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to experimental data of 0.132 kBT (0.37 kJ/mol). PAC-MAC shows a RMSE of 0.151 kBT with a calculation speed being potentially 1.0·10^4 times greater than TI. OPLS-AA force field parameters are optimized using PAC-MAC based on vapor-liquid equilibrium data, instead of enthalpies of vaporization or densities. The RMSE of PAC-MAC is reduced to 0.099 kBT by optimizing 50 force field parameters. The resulting OPLS-PM force field has a comparable accuracy as the OPLS-AA force field in the calculation of mixing free energies using TI. }

Our expressions address the problems of singularities that are intrinsic in popular angle energy functions and that occur from other chain rule derivations of force expressions. Most chain rule derivations of expressions for Cartesian forces due to angle energies make use of relations such as ... where ϕ is a bond or torsion angle, E(ϕ) is energy, and ∂/∂x represents a derivative with respect to some Cartesian coordinate. This expression leads to singularities from the middle term, −1/sin ϕ, when ϕ is 0 or π. This is a problem that prevents the use of torsional energy expressions that have phase angles, ϕ°, other than 0 or π, such as in E(ϕ) = κ[1 + cos(nϕ − phsi;°)]. Our derivations make use of a different, but equivalent, form of the chain rule: ... This form still possesses singularities for the bond angle forces since the last factor is undefined when ϕ is 0 or π. However, the alternate form may be used to great advantage for the torsional angle forces where no such problem arises. The new expressions are necessary if one desires the use of torsional energy expressions with general phase angles. Even for energy expressions in common use, i.e., with phase angles of 0 or π, our force expressions are as computationally efficient as the standard ones. The new expressions are applicable to all molecular simulations that employ restrained, or phase-shifted, torsional angle energy expression}

	The approach is illustrated by its application to two different systems:
	a blocked alanine dipeptide in a vacuum and the C-terminal beta-hairpin
	motif from protein G in water. The first system displays some of
	the desired features of the approach, whereas the second illustrates
	some of the challenges that must be overcome to apply the method
	to more complex biomolecular systems. For both example systems, Boltzmann
	weighted conformations produced by a replica exchange Monte Carlo
	procedure were used as starting states for kinetic trajectories.
	The alanine dipeptide displays Markovian behavior in a state space
	defined with respect to phi-psi torsion angles. In contrast, Markovian
	behavior was not observed for the P-hairpin in a state space where
	all possible native hydrogen bonding patterns were resolved. This
	may be due to our choice of state definitions or sampling limitations.
	Furthermore, the use of different criteria for hydrogen bonding results
	in the apparent observation of different mechanisms from the same
	underlying data: one set of criteria indicate a zipping type of process,
	but another indicates more of a collapse followed by almost simultaneous
	formation of a large number of contacts. Analysis of long-lived states
	observed during the simulations of the beta-hairpin suggests that
	important aspects of the folding process that are not captured by
	order parameters in common use include the formation of non-native
	hydrogen bonds and the degree and nature of salt bridge formation.

abstract = { It is argued here that the functional forms adopted in almost all popular force fields are too restrictive to allow for accurate and physics-based parametrization. Some important modifications are suggested based on symmetry-adapted intermolecular perturbation theory, which directly separates the intermolecular interaction energy into four physically interpretable components: electrostatics, exchange-repulsion, dispersion, and induction. The exact electrostatic energy is approximated as a sum of the short-range contribution (due to charge density penetration effects), included explicitly, and the long-range part (via distributed atomic multipoles), whereas the induction energy is evaluated by means of the distributed induced damped point dipole model. The dispersion energy is fitted to a simple analytical function and the exchange-repulsion contribution is approximated by the overlap of the valence-only electron charge densities of monomers. The water dimer is used to illustrate the approach and to discuss its potential and possible improvements. Analysis of the four main contributions to the binding energy allows for a deeper understanding of the hydrogen bond directionality. It is found that a notorious geometrical preference in the water dimer results mainly from large polarization contributions, including induction and dispersion. }

	burial and hydrogen bonding of polar groups than from the burial
	of nonpolar groups ( Pace, C. N. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 310 - 313).
	To study this further, we prepared eight Thr-to-Val mutants of RNase
	Sa, four in which the Thr side chain is hydrogen-bonded and four
	in which it is not. We measured the stability of these mutants by
	analyzing their thermal denaturation curves. The four hydrogen-bonded
	Thr side chains contribute 1.3 +/- 0.9 kcal/mol to the stability;
	those that are not still contribute 0.4 +/- 0.9 kcal/ mol to the
	stability. For 40 Thr-to-Val mutants of 11 proteins, the average
	decrease in stability is 1.0 +/- 1.0 kcal/ mol when the Thr side
	chain is hydrogen- bonded and 0.0 +/- 0.5 kcal/ mol when it is not.
	This is clear evidence that hydrogen bonds contribute favorably to
	protein stability. In addition, we prepared four Val-to-Thr mutants
	of RNase Sa, measured their stability, and determined their crystal
	structures. In all cases, the mutants are less stable than the wild-type
	protein, with the decreases in stability ranging from 0.5 to 4.4
	kcal/ mol. For 41 Val-to-Thr mutants of 11 proteins, the average
	decrease in stability is 1.8 +/- 1.3 kcal/ mol and is unfavorable
	for 40 of 41 mutants. This shows that placing an - OH group at a
	site designed for a -CH3 group is very unfavorable. So, - OH groups
	can contribute favorably to protein stability, even if they are not
	hydrogen- bonded, if the site was selected for an - OH group, but
	they will make an unfavorable contribution to stability, even if
	they are hydrogen- bonded, when they are placed at a site selected
	for a -CH3 group. The contribution that polar groups make to protein
	stability depends strongly on their environment.},

	the change in solvent-accessible surface area on binding, the effect
	of inhibitor binding on the hydration of the active site, the pK(a)

	Although the changes in inhibitor structure are small, it is demonstrated
	that simple concepts such as steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and
	buried surface area are insufficient to explain the binding data.
	Other factors, such as access to the binding site and the cost of

	In the present studies, vibrational sum-frequency spectroscopy (VSFS)
	is employed in combination with isotopic dilution experiments at

	as the pH is varied with HCl and NaOH. In acidic solutions, solvated
	proton species are seen throughout the interfacial region, and they
	alter the hydrogen bonding between water molecules in ways that reflect
	their depth in the interfacial region. At the higher frequencies
	of the OH stretch region, there is spectral evidence for solvated
	proton species residing in the topmost layers of the interfacial
	region. As reported in previous VSF studies, more strongly bound
	solvated proton species are observed at lower OH stretching frequencies.1-4
	The solvated proton species that have stronger hydrogen bonding are
	similar in structure to those found in bulk acid solutions and likely
	reside somewhat deeper in the interfacial region. There is also evidence
	of OH stretching from solvated protons and relatively strong hydrogen
	bonding in the solvation sphere that is similar to other solvated
	ions. In contrast, water molecules solvating OH- ions show relatively
	weak hydrogen bonding and significantly less interfacial order. VSF

	Thus, we contend that experiments performed on powder samples are

	at room temperature and high hydration, significant water translational
	diffusion and rotational motion occur. At low hydration, the water
	molecules are translationally confined but display appreciable rotational
	motion. Below the protein dynamical transition temperature, both
	translational and rotational motions of the water molecules are essentially
	arrested. Taken together, these results suggest that water translational

  abstract = {Proteomic studies have yielded detailed lists of protein components.
	Relatively little is known, however, of interactions between proteins
	or of their spatial arrangement. To bridge this gap, we are developing
	a mass spectrometry approach based on intact protein complexes. By
	studying intact complexes, we show that we are able to not only determine
	the stoichiometry of all subunits present but also deduce interaction
	maps and topological arrangements of subunits. To construct an interaction
	network, we use tandem mass spectrometry to define peripheral subunits
	and partial denaturation in solution to generate series of subcomplexes.
	These subcomplexes are subsequently assigned using tandem mass spectrometry.
	To facilitate this assignment process, we have developed an iterative
	search algorithm (SUMMIT) to both assign protein subcomplexes and
	generate protein interaction networks. This software package not
	only allows us to construct the subunit architecture of protein assemblies
	but also allows us to explore the limitations and potential of our
	approach. Using series of hypothetical complexes, generated at random
	from protein assemblies containing between six and fourteen subunits,
	we highlight the significance of tandem mass spectrometry for defining
	subunits present. We also demonstrate the importance of pairwise
	interactions and the optimal numbers of subcomplexes required to
	assign networks with up to fourteen subunits. To illustrate application
	of our approach, we describe the overall architecture of two endogenous
	protein assemblies isolated from yeast at natural expression levels,
	the 19S proteasome lid and the RNA exosome. In constructing our models,
	we did not consider previous electron microscopy images but rather
	deduced the subunit architecture from series of sub-complexes and
	our network algorithm. The results show that the proteasome lid complex
	consists of a bicluster with two tetrameric lobes. The exosome lid,
	by contrast, is a six-membered ring with three additional bridging
	subunits that confer stability to the ring and with a large subunit
	located at the base. Significantly, by combining data from MS and
	homology modeling, we were able to construct an atomic model of the
	yeast exosome. In summary, the architectural and atomic models of
	both protein complexes described here have been produced in advance
	of high-resolution structural data and as such provide an initial
	model for testing hypotheses and planning future experiments. In
	the case of the yeast exosome, the atomic model is validated by comparison
	with the atomic structure from X-ray diffraction of crystals of the
	reconstituted human exosome, which is homologous to that of the yeast.
	Overall therefore this mass spectrometry and homology modeling approach
	has given significant insight into the structure of two previously
	intractable protein complexes and as such has broad application in
	structural biology.},

  abstract = {Background: The ab initio protein folding problem consists of predicting
	protein tertiary structure from a given amino acid sequence by minimizing
	an energy function; it is one of the most important and challenging
	problems in biochemistry, molecular biology and biophysics. The ab
	initio protein folding problem is computationally challenging and
	has been shown to be NP-hard even when conformations are restricted
	to a lattice. In this work, we implement and evaluate the replica
	exchange Monte Carlo (REMC) method, which has already been applied
	very successfully to more complex protein models and other optimization
	problems with complex energy landscapes, in combination with the
	highly effective pull move neighbourhood in two widely studied Hydrophobic
	Polar (HP) lattice models. Results: We demonstrate that REMC is highly
	effective for solving instances of the square (2D) and cubic (3D)
	HP protein folding problem. When using the pull move neighbourhood,
	REMC outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for most benchmark
	instances. Additionally, we show that this new algorithm provides
	a larger ensemble of ground-state structures than the existing state-of-the-art
	methods. Furthermore, it scales well with sequence length, and it
	finds significantly better conformations on long biological sequences
	and sequences with a provably unique ground-state structure, which
	is believed to be a characteristic of real proteins. We also present
	evidence that our REMC algorithm can fold sequences which exhibit
	significant interaction between termini in the hydrophobic core relatively
	easily. Conclusion: We demonstrate that REMC utilizing the pull move
	neighbourhood significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
	methods for protein structure prediction in the HP model on 2D and
	3D lattices. This is particularly noteworthy, since so far, the state-of-the-art
	methods for 2D and 3D HP protein folding-in particular, the pruned-enriched
	Rosenbluth method (PERM) and, to some extent, Ant Colony Optimisation
	(ACO)-were based on chain growth mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge,
	this is the first application of REMC to HP protein folding on the
	cubic lattice, and the first extension of the pull move neighbourhood
	to a 3D lattice. 1471-2105}

  abstract = {Quantum and molecular mechanics calculations for the Diels-Alder reactions
	of cyclopentadiene with 1,4-naphthoquinone, methyl vinyl ketone,
	and acrylonitrile have been carried out at the vacuum-water interface
	and in the gas phase. In conjunction with previous studies of these
	cycloadditions in dilute solution, a more complete picture of aqueous
	environmental effects emerges with implications for the origin of
	observed rate accelerations using heterogeneous aqueous suspensions,
	``on water{''} conditions. The pure TIP4P water slab maintains
	the bulk density and hydrogen-bonding properties in central water
	layers. The bulk region merges to vacuum over a ca. 5 angstrom band
	with progressive diminution of the density and hydrogen bonding.
	The relative free energies of activation and transition structures
	for the reactions at the interface are found to be intermediate between
	those calculated in the gas phase and in bulk water; i.e., for the
	reaction with 1,4-naphthoquinone, the Delta Delta G(double dagger)
	values relative to the gas phase are -3.6 and -7.3 kcal/mol at the
	interface and in bulk water, respectively. Thus, the results do not
	support the notion that a water surface is more effective than bulk
	water for catalysis of such pericyclic reactions, The trend is in
	qualitative agreement with expectations based on density considerations
	and estimates of experimental rate constants for the gas phase, a
	heterogeneous aqueous suspension, and a dilute aqueous solution for
	the reaction of cyclopentadiene with methyl vinyl ketone. Computed
	energy pair distributions reveal a uniform loss of 0.5-1.0 hydrogen
	bond for the reactants and transition states in progressing from
	bulk water to the vacuum-water interface. Orientational effects are
	apparent at the surface; e.g., the carbonyl group in the methyl vinyl
	ketone transition structure is preferentially oriented into the surface.
	Also, the transition structure for the 1,4-naphthoquinone case is
	buried more in the surface, and the free energy of activation for
	this reaction is most similar to the result in bulk water.},

	experimental heats of formation and isomerization energies. In addition,
	the effect of an empirical dispersion correction term has been evaluated
	and found to improve agreement with the experimental data. For the
	622 compounds, the mean absolute errors (MAE) in the heats of formation

	B3LYP/ 6-31+G(d,p), and B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) with the dispersion correction.
	A diverse set of 34 isomerizations highlights specific issues of
	general interest, such as performance on differences in steric effects,
	conjugation, and bonding. The corresponding MAEs for the isomerizations
	are 2.7, 2.4, 2.2, and 1.9 kcal/mol. Improvement is obtained for
	isomerizations of amines and alcohols when both polarization and
	diffuse functions are used, but the overstabilization of linear alkanes
	compared to branched isomers can be relieved only with the dispersion
	correction. Besides the insights on DFT methods, the study also aimed
	to quantify the gains in accuracy that can be achieved by replacing
	energetics from NDO-based semiempirical methods with DFT results.
	Since the MAEs obtained with the PDDG/PM3 method for the 622 heats
	of formation and 34 isomerizations are 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, negligible
	advantage in accuracy for the B3LYP-based methods emerged in the

	signaling have not been established. We, therefore, were motivated
	to develop a software environment for building such integrative models
	based on gene sets, and running simulations to conduct experiments
	in silico. Results: E-CELL, a modelling and simulation environment
	for biochemical and genetic processes, has been developed. The E-CELL
	system allows a user to define functions of proteins, protein-protein
	interactions, protein-DNA interactions, regulation of gene expressions
	and other features of cellular cell behavior by numerically integrating
	the differential equations described implicity in these reaction
	rules. The user can observe, through a computer display, dynamic
	changes in concentrations of proteins, protein complexes and other
	chemical compounds in the cell. Using this software, we constructed
	a model of a hypothetical cell with only 127 genes sufficient for
	transcription, translation, energy production and phospholipid synthesis.
	Most of the genes are taken from Mycoplasma genitalium, the organism
	having the smallest known chromosome, whose complete 580 kb genome
	sequence was determined at TIGR in 1995. We discuss future applications
	of the E-CELL system with special respect to genome engineering.

  abstract={Distributed multipoles obtained from the Gaussian electrostatic model (GEM) have been previously shown to be amenable for use in the AMOEBA force field [JCTC(2012) 12, 5072]. GEM distributed multipoles (GEM-DM) were determined for several systems including water. This previous AMOEBA water model with GEM-DM included only monopoles on the hydrogens and multipoles up to quadrupoles on the oxygen. This model showed good agreement with experiment for several properties at room temperature, but not at higher temperatures. In this contribution, we present the development of an AMOEBA water model using GEM-DM with distributed multipoles for each atomic site up to the quadrupole level. Quantum mechanical energy decomposition analysis has been employed to compare each term of the force field for parametrization. The inclusion of higher-order multipoles on hydrogen atoms is shown to provide better agreement with experiment on a number of properties including liquid density ($\rho$), enthalpy of vaporization ($\Delta$Hvap), heat capacity (Cp), and self-diffusion coefficient (D) for a range of temperatures.}

The resulting values of the crystal radii agree within 0.05 {\AA} with the values obtained in I with the Huggins-Mayer and Pauling forms. This indicates that the Born model, irrespective of the specific plausible form adopted for the Born repulsive energy, leads to relative values of the crystal radii for the alkali and halogen ions in the NaCl structure exceeding by about 0.3 {\AA} the traditional relative values, which refer to nearly free ions. Qualitative and quantitative evidence supporting these ionic deformations is discussed."

Ice II, ice V, and ice XIII have been chosen for this study, since this selection covers many aspects of the polymorphism of ice. That is, ice II is a hydrogen-ordered phase of ice, in contrast to ice Ih, while ice V and ice XIII are a hydrogen-disordered/ordered couple that shares essentially the same oxygen structure and hydrogen-bonded network. For the transmission 2D IR spectroscopy, a novel method had to be developed for the preparation of ultrathin films (1-2 μm) of high-pressure ices with good optical quality. We also simulated 2D IR spectra based on molecular dynamics simulations connected to a vibrational exciton picture. These simulations agree with the experimental results in a semi-quantitative manner for ice II, while the same approach failed for ice V and ice XIII. From the perspective of 2D IR spectroscopy, ice II appears to be more inhomogeneously broadened than ice Ih, despite its hydrogen-order, which we attribute to the fact that ice II is structurally more complex with four distinguishable hydrogen bonds that mix due to exciton coupling. Ice V and ice XIII, on the other hand, behave as expected with the hydrogen-disordered case (ice V) being more inhomogenously broadened. Furthermore, in all hydrogen-ordered forms (ice II and ice XIII), cross peaks could be identified in the anisotropic 2D IR spectrum, whose signs reveal the relative direction of the corresponding excitonic states.

abstract = { In a theoretical description of homogeneous nucleation one frequently assumes an “equilibrium” coexistence of a liquid droplet with surrounding vapor of a density exceeding that of a saturated vapor at bulk vapor-liquid two-phase coexistence. Thereby one ignores the caveat that in the thermodynamic limit, for which the vapor would be called supersaturated, such states will at best be metastable with finite lifetime, and thus not be well-defined within equilibrium statistical mechanics. In contrast, in a system of finite volume stable equilibrium coexistence of droplet and supersaturated vapor at constant total density is perfectly possible, and numerical analysis of equilibrium free energies of finite systems allows to obtain physically relevant results. In particular, such an analysis can be used to derive the dependence of the droplet surface tension γ(R) on the droplet radius R by computer simulations. Unfortunately, however, the precision of the results produced by this approach turns out to be seriously affected by a hitherto unexplained spurious dependence of γ(R) on the total volume V of the simulation box. These finite size effects are studied here for the standard Ising/lattice gas model in d = 2 dimensions and an Ising model on the face-centered cubic lattice with 3-spin interaction, lacking symmetry between vapor and liquid phases. There also the analogous case of bubbles surrounded by undersaturated liquid is treated. It is argued that (at least a large part of) the finite size effects result from the translation entropy of the droplet or bubble in the system. This effect has been shown earlier to occur also for planar interfaces for simulations in the slab geometry. Consequences for the estimation of the Tolman length are briefly discussed. In particular, we find clear evidence that in d = 2 the leading correction of the curvature-dependent interface tension is a logarithmic term, compatible with theoretical expectations, and we show that then the standard Tolman-style analysis is inapplicable. }

  abstract = {The idea of using a dielectric continuum inside a molecule to accurately
	model molecular polarizability is extended to include a larger spectrum
	of bioorganic molecules and the condensed phase. Atomic polarization
	radii and an internal dielectric (epsilon(in)) were fitted to reproduce
	ab initio B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ polarizability tensors taken from a data
	set of 707 molecules. The average unsigned error on the isotropic
	polarizability and anisotropy are 2.6\% and 5.2\%, respectively.
	It is shown that usual Poisson-Boltzmann contact radii and a low
	internal dielectric are not appropriate and require major revision.
	To account for the anisotropy of polarizability, the internal dielectric
	(epsilon(in)) constant needs to be larger than 6.0. Reinterpreting
	the theoretical link between epsilon(in) and the experimental refractive
	index (n), this study shows, with a set of 23 organic molecules spanning
	the entire range of n, that even with epsilon(in) = 24 the obtained
	refractive indices can correlate well with experiment (slope of 1.00,
	intercept of 0.05, and R = 0.95). The novel methodology used here
	to calculate a macroscopic-like refractive index shows that the application
	of the EPIC parametrization to condensed phase leads to suitable
	behavior. Although the primary goal in developing EPIC was to include
	polarizability in explicit solvent calculations, we also extend the
	model to work with implicit solvent. This requires the use of a 3-zone
	smooth dielectric function to transition from the polarization dielectric
	inside the molecules to the dielectric continuum of the solvent,
	The parametrization and validation of this model are performed against
	485 experimental free energies of hydration. Using 8 solvent cavity
	atomic radii and a single surface tension an average unsigned error
	of 1.1 kal/mol and a correlation coefficient of 0.9 are obtained,
	validating the use of the EPIC model in the condensed phase.},

abstract = {Most empirical force fields use atom-centered point charges (PCs) to represent the electrostatic potential (ESP) around molecules. While such PC models are computationally efficient, they are unable to capture anisotropic electronic features, such as $\sigma$ holes or lone pairs. These features are better described using atomic multipole (MTP) moments, which significantly improve the quality of the resulting ESP. However, the improvement comes at the expense of a considerably increased computational complexity and cost for calculating the interaction energies and forces. In the present work, a novel minimal distributed charge model (MDCM) based on off-centered point charges is presented and the quality of the resulting ESP is compared to the performance of MTPs and atom-centered PC models for several test molecules. All three models are fitted using the same algorithm based on differential evolution, which is available as a Fortran90 program from the authors upon request. We show that the MDCM is capable of approximating the reference ab initio ESP with an accuracy as good as, or better than, MTPs without the need for computationally expensive higher order multipoles. Further it is demonstrated that the MDCM is numerically stable in molecular dynamics simulations and is able to reproduce electrostatic interaction energies and thermodynamic quantities with the same accuracy as MTPs at reduced computational cost.}

abstract = { In the early days of computation, slow processor speeds limited the amount of data that could be generated and used for scientific purposes. In the age of big data, the limiting factor usually is the method with which large amounts of data are analyzed and useful information is extracted. A typical example from chemistry are high-level ab initio calculations for small systems, which have nowadays become feasible even if energies at many different geometries are required. Molecular dynamics simulations often require several thousand distinct trajectories to be run. Under such circumstances suitable analytical representations of potential energy surfaces (PESs) based on ab initio calculations are required to propagate the dynamics at an acceptable cost. In this work we introduce a toolkit which allows the automatic construction of multidimensional PESs from gridded ab initio data based on reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory. The resulting representations require no tuning of parameters and allow energy and force evaluations at ab initio quality at the same cost as empirical force fields. Although the toolkit is primarily intended for constructing multidimensional potential energy surfaces for molecular systems, it can also be used for general machine learning purposes. The software is published under the MIT license and can be downloaded, modified, and used in other projects for free. }

	used chemically synthesized variants of the stem-loop fragment and
	soaked them into crystals of recombinant capsids. The RNA stem-loop,
	as bound to the protein, forms a crescent-like structure and interacts

	protein contacts with seven phosphate groups on the 51 side of the
	stem-loop, with a pyrimidine base at position -5, which stacks onto
	a tyrosine, and with two exposed adenine bases, one in the loop and
	one at a bulge in the stem. Replacement of the wild-type uridine
	with a cytosine at position -5 increases the affinity of the RNA

abstract = { We propose a methodology to derive pairwise-additive noncovalent force fields from monomer electron densities without any empirical input. Energy expressions are based on the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) decomposition of interaction energies. This ensures a physically motivated force field featuring an electrostatic, exchange-repulsion, dispersion, and induction contribution, which contains two types of parameters. First, each contribution depends on several fixed atomic parameters, resulting from a partitioning of the monomer electron density. Second, each of the last three contributions (exchange-repulsion, dispersion, and induction) contains exactly one linear fitting parameter. These three so-called interaction parameters in the model are initially estimated separately using SAPT reference calculations for the S66x8 database of noncovalent dimers. In a second step, the three interaction parameters are further refined simultaneously to reproduce CCSD(T)/CBS interaction energies for the same database. The limited number of parameters that are fitted to dimer interaction energies (only three) avoids ill-conditioned fits that plague conventional parameter optimizations. For the exchange-repulsion and dispersion component, good results are obtained for all dimers in the S66x8 database using one single value for the associated interaction parameters. The values of those parameters can be considered universal and can also be used for dimers not present in the original database used for fitting. For the induction component such an approach is only viable for the dispersion-dominated dimers in the S66x8 database. For other dimers (such as hydrogen-bonded complexes), we show that our methodology remains applicable. However, the interaction parameter needs to be determined on a case-specific basis. As an external validation, the force field predicts interaction energies in good agreement with CCSD(T)/CBS values for dispersion-dominated dimers extracted from an HIV-II protease crystal structure with a bound ligand (indinavir). Furthermore, experimental second virial coefficients of small alkanes and alkenes are well reproduced. }

	The stability of the peptides was compared qualitatively by analyzing
	the root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystal structure,
	radius of gyration, secondary and tertiary structure, and solvent
	accessible surface area. In agreement with earlier MD studies, relatively
	short (< 15 amino acids) peptides containing individual secondary

	binding fold (Rossmann fold) of LDH is somewhat more stable than
	other units of similar length and that the alpha 2-helix, which unfolds
	by itself, is stabilized by binding to this unit. This finding suggests
	that the first beta alpha beta unit could function as an N-terminal
	folding nucleus, upon which the remainder of the polypeptide chain
	can be assembled. Indeed, simulations with longer units (beta-alpha-beta-alpha

abstract = { Molecular mechanics force fields are widely used in computer-aided drug design for the study of drug-like molecules alone or interacting with biological systems. In simulations involving biological macromolecules, the biological part is typically represented by a specialized biomolecular force field, while the drug is represented by a matching general (organic) force field. In order to apply these general force fields to an arbitrary drug-like molecule, functionality for assignment of atom types, parameters, and charges is required. In the present article, which is part I of a series of two, we present the algorithms for bond perception and atom typing for the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF). The CGenFF atom typer first associates attributes to the atoms and bonds in a molecule, such as valence, bond order, and ring membership among others. Of note are a number of features that are specifically required for CGenFF. This information is then used by the atom typing routine to assign CGenFF atom types based on a programmable decision tree. This allows for straightforward implementation of CGenFF's complicated atom typing rules and for equally straightforward updating of the atom typing scheme as the force field grows. The presented atom typer was validated by assigning correct atom types on 477 model compounds including in the training set as well as 126 test-set molecules that were constructed to specifically verify its different components. The program may be utilized via an online implementation at https://www.paramchem.org/. }

To accurately calculate the heats of formation, the following additional correction were included: scalar relativistic effects, atomic spin-orbit effects, and vibrational zero-point energies. For calibration purposes, the properties of some of the lithium compounds were predicted with iterative triple and quadruple excitations via CCSDT and CCSDTQ. The calculated geometry parameters, frequencies, heats of formation, and bond dissociation energies were compared with all available experimental measurements and are in excellent agreement with high-quality experimental data. High-level calculations are required to correctly predict that K2O is linear and that the ground state of KO is 2Sigma+, not 2Pi, as in LiO and NaO. This reliable and consistent set of calculated thermodynamic data is appropriate for use in combustion and atmospheric simulations. }

	as Lennard-Jonesium and water/ice, as well as multicomponent systems
	such as methane hydrate crystals. The setup uses periodicity in all

	occurs, while at the other, melting is enforced by locally heating
	the crystal only near that interface. Steady-state conditions are
	achieved when the crystal is melted at the same rate as the growth

	of melting to match the rate of growth, crucial for establishing
	steady-state conditions, is described. In contrast with the recently
	developed method of Razul [Mol. Phys. 103, 1929 (2005)], where the
	rates of growth (melting) were constant and the temperatures determined,
	the present approach fixes the supercooling temperature at the growing

	rate that corresponds to the thermodynamic force provided. The static

abstract ={There is overwhelming evidence that ions are present near the vapor-liquid interface of aqueous salt solutions. Charged groups can also be driven to interfaces by attaching them to hydrophobic moieties. Despite their importance in many self-assembly phenomena, how ion-ion interactions are affected by interfaces is not understood. We use molecular simulations to show that the effective forces between small ions change character dramatically near the water vapor-liquid interface. Specifically, the water-mediated attraction between oppositely charged ions is enhanced relative to that in bulk water. Further, the repulsion between like-charged ions is weaker than that expected from a continuum dielectric description and can even become attractive as the ions are drawn to the vapor side. We show that thermodynamics of ion association are governed by a delicate balance of ion hydration, interfacial tension, and restriction of capillary fluctuations at the interface, leading to nonintuitive phenomena, such as water-mediated like charge attraction. "Sticky" electrostatic interactions may have important consequences on biomolecular structure, assembly, and aggregation at soft liquid interfaces. We demonstrate this by studying an interfacially active model peptide that changes its structure from $\alpha$-helical to a hairpin-turn-like one in response to charging of its ends.},

abstract = { Damped dispersion can be a significant component of the interaction energy in many physical and chemical processes, for example, physisorption and noncovalent complexation. For physically interpreting and modeling such processes, it is convenient to have an analytic method to calculate damped dispersion that is readily applicable across the entire periodic table. Of the available methods to calculate damped dispersion energy for interacting systems with overlapping charge distributions, we select symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) as providing a reasonable definition, and of the possible analytic forms, we choose the D3(BJ) method. However, the available parametrizations of D3(BJ) include not only damped dispersion energy but also corrections for errors in specific exchange-correlation functionals. Here we present a parametrization that provides a physical measure of damped dispersion without such density functional corrections. The method generalizes an earlier method of Pernal and co-workers to all elements from hydrogen to plutonium. }

  abstract = {An extensive benchmark of the electronegativity equalization method
	(EEM) and the split charge equilibration (SQE) model on a very diverse
	set of organic molecules is presented. These models efficiently compute
	atomic partial charges and are used in the development of polarizable
	force fields. The predicted partial charges that depend on empirical
	parameters are calibrated to reproduce results from quantum mechanical
	calculations. Recently, SQE is presented as an extension of the EEM
	to obtain the correct size dependence of the molecular polarizability.
	In this work, 12 parametrization protocols are applied to each model
	and the optimal parameters are benchmarked systematically. The training
	data for the empirical parameters comprise of MP2/Aug-CC-pVDZ calculations
	on 500 organic molecules containing the elements H, C, N, O, F, S,
	Cl, and Br. These molecules have been selected by an ingenious and
	autonomous protocol from an initial set of almost 500 000 small organic
	molecules. It is clear that the SQE model outperforms the EEM in
	all benchmark assessments. When using Hirshfeld-I charges for the
	calibration, the SQE model optimally reproduces the molecular electrostatic
	potential from the ab initio calculations. Applications on chain
	molecules, i.e., alkanes, alkenes, and alpha alanine helices, confirm
	that the EEM gives rise to a divergent behavior for the polarizability,

abstract = {We evaluate the ability of selected classical molecular models to describe the thermodynamic and structural aspects of gas-phase hydration of alkali metal halide ions and the formation of small water clusters. To understand the effect of many-body interactions (polarization) and charge penetration effects on the accuracy of a force field, we perform Monte Carlo simulations with three rigid water models using different functional forms to account for these effects: (i) point charge nonpolarizable SPC/E, (ii) Drude point charge polarizable SWM4-DP, and (iii) Drude Gaussian charge polarizable BK3. Model predictions are compared with experimental Gibbs free energies and enthalpies of ion hydration, and with microscopic structural properties obtained from quantum DFT calculations. We find that all three models provide comparable predictions for pure water clusters and cation hydration but differ significantly in their description of anion hydration. None of the investigated classical force fields can consistently and quantitatively reproduce the experimental gas-phase hydration thermodynamics. The outcome of this study highlights the relation between the functional form that describes the effective intermolecular interactions and the accuracy of the resulting ion hydration properties.}

abstract = {While quantum chemical simulations have been increasingly used as an invaluable source of information for atomistic model development, the high computational expenses typically associated with these techniques often limit thorough sampling of the systems of interest. It is therefore of great practical importance to use all available information as efficiently as possible, and in a way that allows for consistent addition of constraints that may be provided by macroscopic experiments. Here we propose a simple approach that combines information from configurational energies and forces generated in a molecular dynamics simulation to increase the effective number of samples. Subsequently, this information is used to optimize a molecular force field by minimizing the statistical distance similarity metric. We illustrate the methodology on an example of a trajectory of configurations generated in equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of argon and water and compare the results with those based on the force matching method.}

	used as proxies for oxygenated organic matter found in the atmosphere:
	raffinose, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-DL-mandelic acid (HMMA), levoglucosan,
	and a multi-component mixture of raffinose with five dicarboxylic
	acids and ammonium sulphate. Similar to previous experiments with
	citric acid aerosols, all particles were found to nucleate ice heterogeneously
	before reaching the homogeneous freezing threshold provided that
	the freezing cycles were started well below the respective glass
	transition temperatures of the compounds; this is discussed in detail
	in a separate article. In this contribution, we identify a further
	mechanism by which glassy aerosols can promote ice nucleation below
	the homogeneous freezing limit. If the glassy aerosol particles are
	probed in freezing cycles started only a few degrees below their
	respective glass transition temperatures, they enter the liquid regime
	of the state diagram upon increasing relative humidity (moisture-induced
	glass-to-liquid transition) before being able to act as heterogeneous
	ice nuclei. Ice formation then only occurs by homogeneous freezing
	at elevated supersaturation levels. When ice forms the remaining
	solution freeze concentrates and re-vitrifies. If these ice cloud
	processed glassy aerosol particles are then probed in a second freezing
	cycle at the same temperature, they catalyse ice formation at a supersaturation
	threshold between 5 and 30\%\% with respect to ice. By analogy with
	the enhanced ice nucleation ability of insoluble ice nuclei like
	mineral dusts after they nucleate ice once, we refer to this phenomenon
	as pre-activation. We propose a number of possible explanations for
	why glassy aerosol particles that have re-vitrified in contact with
	the ice crystals during the preceding homogeneous freezing cycle
	exhibit pre-activation: they may retain small ice embryos in pores,
	have footprints on their surface which match the ice lattice, or
	simply have a much greater surface area or different surface microstructure
	compared to the unprocessed glassy aerosol particles. Pre-activation
	must be considered for the correct interpretation of experimental
	results on the heterogeneous ice nucleation ability of glassy aerosol
	particles and may provide a mechanism of producing a population of
	extremely efficient ice nuclei in the upper troposphere.}

  abstract = {Water temperature may through its effects on body mass, reproductive
	output and recruitment of bivalves also influence organisms higher
	up the food chain. The small sized Baltic blue mussel (Mytilus trossulus
	x Mytilus edulis) is a dominant key species in the Baltic Sea food
	web and it is an important food source for sea ducks such as the
	common eider (Somateria mollissima) and the long-tailed duck (Clangula
	hyemalis) and for some species of fish. Possible links between winter
	water temperature and the quality of blue mussels as food for wintering
	sea ducks were investigated by measuring the soft body mass loss
	of mussels during winter in an experimental set-up and in the field.
	Results demonstrated that warmer water temperatures in winter had
	a significant negative effect on soft body mass of Baltic blue mussels.
	Analysed mussels, on average 15 mm in length, kept in experimental
	aquaria between January and March and exposed to a 3.6 degrees C
	elevated water temperature regime corresponding to conditions during
	mild winters, had about 11\% smaller tissue dry mass in March than
	mussels exposed to a water temperature regime corresponding to conditions
	in cold winters. At two field study areas, the body mass loss of
	mussels from October to March in a mild winter was significant and
	more pronounced (15\% and 19\%, respectively) than in a cold winter
	(11\% and 4\% respectively). This difference is of importance because
	in winter and spring, sea ducks build up energy stores for the subsequent
	breeding season by consuming large quantities of blue mussels and
	the energy gain of the birds per dive will be affected by the soft
	body tissue content of the mussels. The results improve our possibilities
	to predict the seasonal and yearly variation of the quality of the
	main food of sea ducks and help us to better understand the causes
	for the variable reproductive success and the present population
	declines of sea ducks. The results may also improve our possibilities
	to model the effects on Baltic Sea food webs of possible future increases
	in water temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	ligand binding free energies, suggesting that this type of technique
	could be used also in a high-throughput fashion. However, a limiting
	step in such applications is the assignment of atomic charges for
	compounds that have not been parametrized within the given force
	field, in this case OPLS-AA. In order to reach an automatable solution
	to this problem, we have examined the performance of nine different
	ab initio and semiempirical charge methods, together with estimates
	of solvent induced polarization. A test set of ten HIV-1 reverse
	transcriptase inhibitors was selected, and LIE estimates of their
	relative binding free energies were calculated using the resulting
	23 different charge variants. Over 800 ns of MD simulation show that
	the LIE method provides excellent estimates with several different
	charge methods and that the semiempirically derived CM1A charges,
	in particular, emerge as a fast and reliable alternative for fully
	automated LIE based virtual screens with the OPLS-AA force field.
	Our conclusions regarding different charge models are also expected
	to be valid for other types of force field based binding free energy
	calculations, such as free energy perturbation and thermodynamic
	integration simulations.},

Data for the most accurate available ground electronic state pairwise intermolecular potentials in H2, HD, D2, HeH+, and LiH are used to rigorously evaluate such transformations. The corresponding potentials are generated explicitly using parameters calculated with algebraic functions from that of the single canonical potential of the simplest molecule, H2+. The efficacy of this approach is further tested by direct comparison of the predicted eigenvalues of all vibrational states in the selected molecular systems considered with the corresponding most accurately known Born-Oppenheimer eigenvalues currently available. Deviations are demonstrated to be less than 2 cm-1 for all vibrational states in H2, HD, D2, HeH+, and LiH, with an average standard deviation of 0.27 cm-1 for the 87 states considered. The implications of these results for molecular quantum chemistry are discussed. }

Abstract = {{The accurate modeling of systems containing water and hydrocarbons is
   important to support key decisions related to the design, simulation,
   and optimization of a variety of industrial processes, ranging from
   refineries, to gas plants and liquified natural gas processing
   facilities. Processes of interest for the production of hydrocarbons now
   include widely different temperatures and pressure ranges, making the
   use of empirical models to simulate the behavior of water and
   hydrocarbon mixtures awkward and prone to inconsistencies. In this work
   we show that the use of the Peng-Robinson equation of state using the
   Huron-Vidal mixing rule combined with the nonrandom two-liquid model and
   temperature-dependent interaction parameters provide an accurate
   platform to correlate mutual solubility data for a variety of
   hydrocarbons. Moreover, the interaction parameters were correlated on
   the basis of simple molecular descriptors such as molecular weight and
   the paraffin, iso-paraffin, olefin, naphthene, and aromatic (PIONA)
   chemical family classification and Watson-K factor. The model shows an
   absolute average error in water mole fraction in the hydrocarbon phase
   equal to 34\% and an absolute average error in the hydrocarbon mole
   fraction in the aqueous phase equal to 98\% using the PIONA-based
   parameters and an absolute average error in water mole fraction in the
   hydrocarbon phase equal to 34\% and an absolute average error in the
   hydrocarbon mole fraction in the aqueous phase equal to 148\% using the

   stable and large aggregates poses significant sampling challenges. The
   trajectories of independent simulations started from different initial
   compositions indicate either (i) that equilibrium has not yet been
   achieved, (ii) that composition fluctuations are sampled insufficiently
   over the current trajectory lengths, or (iii) that the system size is
   too small. Based on these preliminary simulation data, cautious
   estimates of the mutual solubilities at temperatures from 283 to 353 K
   are made using a model with modified charges. These predictions yield
   mean signed deviations from the experimental benchmark data for the

Abstract = {{It is a challenging task to accurately compute the structures and
   physicochemical properties of partially soluble liquid mixtures using
   classical force field simulation methods due to the limitations of both
   sampling and intermolecular potential. In the present study, we employed
   replica exchange molecular dynamics in combination with the AMOEBA
   polarizable force field to simulate partially miscible liquid mixtures
   of dipropylene glycol dimethyl ether and water. We demonstrated that our
   strategy is promising in studying such complicated binary mixture
   systems without involving empirical fitting of any available
   experimental data of mixtures. We correctly predicted the trend of
   liquid concentration distribution as the function of temperature, and
   the concentration drifts found in the simulations are consistent with
   the concentration difference between experimental values and initial
   configurations. Based on self-diffusion coefficient analysis, the lower
   critical solution temperature of the system was identified at about
   290K. which is in satisfactory agreement with experimental evidence.
   Although accurate concentration prediction of such a partially miscible
   system using direct molecular dynamics method remains an intractable
   task, we expect that such atomistic simulations will play a more
   important role in future studies of liquid mixtures. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A critical collection of data for the mutual solubilities of water and
   hydrocarbons (HC) recently presented by Tsonopoulos is used for careful
   analysis of the ability of a priori prediction method conductor-like
   screening model-real solvents (COSMO-RS) to predict the infinite
   dilution activity coefficients in such dissimilar systems. Although only
   few data of hydrocarbon-water mixtures had been used in the
   parameterization of COSMO-RS, the mutual solubilities of hydrocarbons
   (n-alkanes, 1-alkenes, alkylbenzenes, and alkylcyclohexanes) and water
   are quite well predicted by COSMO-RS. All trends of the solubilities
   with respect to carbon number (CN) of the hydrocarbons are very well
   reproduced. Some moderate deviations are observed for the temperature
   dependence (solvation enthalpy) of hydrocarbon solubility in water,
   while the temperature dependence of the water solubility in various
   hydrocarbons is reproduced almost within the experimental error up to
   temperatures of about 473 K.
   The good qualitative and even satisfactory quantitative prediction of
   the solubilities of hydrocarbons in water proves that COSMO-RS correctly
   reflects the physics of the hydrophobic solvation, i.e. the fact that
   the largest part of the free energy of solution of hydrocarbons in water
   is of entropic nature due to the re-organization of the water molecules
   around non-polar compounds. This is especially unexpected, because the
   COSMO-RS method does not takes into account the 3D-geornetry of
   solute-solvent arrangements. An explanation is given, how the physics of
   water re-organization around non-polar surface is nevertheless described
   by COSMO-RS. Some ideas for further improvement of COSMO-RS regarding
   the mutual solubilities of hydrocarbons and water are discussed. (C)

  abstract = {Polarizability is considered to be the single most significant development
	in the next generation of force fields for biomolecular simulations.
	However, the self-consistent computation of induced atomic dipoles
	in a polarizable force field is expensive due to the cost of solving
	a large dense linear system at each step of a simulation. This article
	introduces methods that reduce the cost of computing the electrostatic
	energy and force of a polarizable model from about 7.5 times the
	cost of computing those of a nonpolarizable model to less than twice
	the cost. This is probably sufficient for the routine use of polarizable
	forces in biomolecular simulations. The reduction in computing time
	is achieved by an efficient implementation of the particle-mesh Ewald
	method, an accurate and robust predictor based on least-squares fitting,
	and non-stationary iterative methods whose fast convergence is accelerated
	by a simple preconditioner. Furthermore, with these methods, the
	self-consistent approach with a larger timestep is shown to be faster
	than the extended Lagrangian approach. The use of dipole moments
	from previous timesteps to calculate an accurate initial guess for
	iterative methods leads to an energy drift, which can be made acceptably
	small. The use of a zero initial guess does not lead to perceptible
	energy drift if a reasonably strict convergence criterion for the
	iteration is imposed. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics. 0021-9606}

  abstract = {Molecular mechanical force field (FF) methods are useful in studying
	condensed phase properties. They are complementary to experiments
	and can often go beyond experiments in atomic details. Even if a
	FF is specific for studying structures, dynamics, and functions of
	biomolecules, it is still important for the FF to accurately reproduce
	the experimental liquid properties of small molecules that represent
	the chemical moieties of biomolecules. Otherwise, the force field
	may not describe the structures and energies of macromolecules in
	aqueous solutions properly. In this work, we have carried out a systematic
	study to evaluate the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) in studying
	densities and heats of vaporization for a large set of organic molecules
	that covers the most common chemical functional groups. The latest
	techniques, such as the particle mesh Ewald (PME) for calculating
	electrostatic energies and Langevin dynamics for scaling temperatures,
	have been applied in the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For
	density, the average percent error (APE) of 71 organic compounds
	is 4.43\% when compared to the experimental values. More encouragingly,
	the APE drops to 3.43\% after the exclusion of two outliers and four
	other compounds for which the experimental densities have been measured
	with pressures higher than 1.0 atm. For the heat of vaporization,
	several protocols have been investigated, and the best one, P4/ntt0,
	achieves an average unsigned error (AUE) and a root-mean-square error
	(RMSE) of 0.93 and 1.20 kcal/mol, respectively. How to reduce the
	prediction errors through proper van der Waals (vdW) parametrization
	has been discussed. An encouraging finding in vdW parametrization
	is that both densities and heats of vaporization approach their "ideal"
	values in a synchronous fashion when vdW parameters are tuned. The
	following hydration free energy calculation using thermodynamic integration
	further justifies the vdW refinement. We conclude that simple vdW
	parametrization can significantly reduce the prediction errors. We
	believe that GAFF can greatly improve its performance in predicting
	liquid properties of organic molecules after a systematic vdW parametrization,
	which will be reported in a separate paper.}

The effects of LiCl on the local structures and transport properties as the self-diffusion coefficients, viscosities and ionic conductivities of molten NaCl and KCl as well as the mixing effects between NaCl and KCl have been calculated and analyzed. The results reveal that the Tosi-Fumi potential predicts negative composition dependence for density and positive composition dependences for ionic diffusivity and ionic conductivity as the contents of LiCl are increased for molten LiCl-NaCl and LiCl-KCl. As the KCl contents are increased, the ionic diffusivity of molten KCl-NaCl shows weak composition dependence. However, the density and ionic conductivity exhibit negative composition dependences. The transport performances of these mixed melts are dominated by the local structures and interatomic forces. The shear viscosities of the mixtures decrease firstly and then increase under the influences of these two factors. For molten KCl or NaCl, with the addition of a smaller cation (Li+), the interactions between counter ions and closed packs between anions are weakened, while closed packs between cations are promoted. What's more, the smaller the added ion is, the more pronounced the effects are. However, the addition of a larger cation presents the opposite effects."

abstract = "The effects of LiCl and NaCl on the local structures and transport properties as the self-diffusion coefficients, viscosities and ionic conductivities of molten RbCl and CsCl have been calculated and analyzed in detail at 1100K across the full composition range by molecular dynamics simulations. For molten RbCl or CsCl, with the gradual addition of a smaller cation (Li+ or Na+), the densities of the mixed salts decrease monotonously, besides, the cationic-anionic interactions and the interactions between cations become weaker, while the corresponding atomic close packing gets a promotion respectively. Influenced by the local structures and interatomic forces simultaneously, the shear viscosities of molten LiCl-RbCl, LiCl-CsCl, NaCl-RbCl and NaCl-CsCl decrease firstly and then present slightly fluctuated variations as the contents of LiCl or NaCl are increased, being in consonance with the available experimental results. In addition, the ionic diffusivity and ionic conductivity of each system present positive composition dependences along with the increase of LiCl or NaCl concentration. Besides, the effects of LiCl on the local structures and transport properties of RbCl and CsCl are more pronounced than those of NaCl."

	(TIP4P-FQ) are computed using several commonly employed ion-water

	for use with the simple water model with four sites and Drude polarizability

	incorporates a number of finite-system free energy corrections within
	the context of constant pressure molecular dynamics simulations employing
	the Ewald method and periodic boundary conditions. The agreement

	good transferability of ion force fields from these water models
	to TIP4Q-FQ even when ion polarizability is neglected. To assess
	the performance of the ion models in TIP4P-FQ, we compare with consensus
	values for single-ion hydration free energies arising from recently
	improved cluster-pair estimates and a reevaluation of commonly cited,
	experimentally derived single-ion hydration free energies; we couple
	the observed consistency of these energies with a justification of
	the cluster-pair approximation in assigning single-ion hydration
	free energies to advocate the use of these consensus energies as
	a benchmark set in the parametrization of future ion force fields.

  abstract = {Water is an extremely important liquid for chemistry and the search for more accurate force fields for liquid water continues unabated. Neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) molecular orbital methods provide and intriguing generalization of classical force fields in this regard because they can account both for bond breaking and electronic polarization of molecules. However, we show that most standard NDDO methods fail for water because they give an incorrect description of hydrogen bonding, water's key structural feature. Using force matching, we design a reparameterized NDDO model and find that it qualitatively reproduces the experimental radial distribution function of water, as well as various monomer, dimer, and bulk properties that PM6 does not. This suggests that the apparent limitations of NDDO models are primarily due to poor parameterization and not to the NDDO approximations themselves. Finally, we identify the physical parameters that most influence the condensed phase properties. These results help to elucidate the chemistry that a semiempirical molecular orbital picture of water must capture. We conclude that properly parameterized NDDO models could be useful for simulations that require electronically detailed explicit solvent, including the calculation of redox potentials and simulation of charge transfer and photochemistry.},

  abstract = {Cholesterol plays an important role in maintaining the correct fluidity
	and rigidity of the plasma membrane of all animal cells, and hence,
	it is present in concentrations ranging from 20 to 50 mol \%. Whereas
	the effect of cholesterol on such mechanical properties has been
	studied exhaustively over the last decades, the structural basis
	for cholesterol effects on membrane permeability is still unclear.
	Here we apply systematic molecular dynamics simulations to study
	the partitioning of solutes between water and membranes. We derive
	potentials of mean force for six different solutes permeating across
	20 different lipid membranes containing one out of four types of
	phospholipids plus a cholesterol content varying from 0 to 50 mol
	\%. Surprisingly, cholesterol decreases solute partitioning into
	the lipid tail region of the membranes much more strongly than expected
	from experiments on macroscopic membranes, suggesting that a laterally
	inhomogeneous cholesterol concentration and permeability may be required
	to explain experimental findings. The simulations indicate that the
	cost of breaking van der Waals interactions between the lipid tails
	of cholesterol-containing membranes account for the reduced partitioning
	rather than the surface area per phospholipid, which has been frequently
	suggested as a determinant for solute partitioning. The simulations
	further show that the partitioning is more sensitive to cholesterol
	(i) for larger solutes, (ii) in membranes with saturated as compared
	to membranes with unsaturated lipid tails, and (iii) in membranes
	with smaller lipid head groups.},

The considered molecular models consist of up to 28 interaction sites, including Lennard-Jones sites, point charges, dipoles, and quadrupoles. They represent 33 real fluids, such as ethylene oxide, sulfur dioxide, phosgene, benzene, ammonia, formaldehyde, methanol, and water, and were adjusted to reproduce the saturated liquid density, the vapour pressure, and the enthalpy of vaporization. The models were not adjusted to interfacial properties, however, so that the present MD simulations are a test of model predictions. It is found that all of the considered models overestimate the surface tension. In most cases, however, the relative deviation between the simulation results and correlations to experimental data is smaller than 20%%. This observation corroborates the outcome of previous studies on the surface tension of two-centre Lennard-Jones plus point quadrupole (2CLJQ) and two-centre Lennard-Jones plus point dipole (2CLJD) fluid models, where an overestimation of the order of 10 to 20% was found."

	calculated molecular geometries to results obtained from coupled-cluster
	{[}CCSD/6-31+G(d,p)) wave function theory (WFT). We found that

	cluster and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, followed
	by aqueous-phase DFT calculations, where the effect of solvent is
	treated by the SM6 quantum mechanical implicit solvation model. The

	SM5.4 and SM5.42 quantum mechanical implicit solvation models for
	SE-MO and explicit solvation was used for MM. In addition, we substituted
	CM4 charges into the MM force fields tested to observe the effect
	of improved charge assignment on geometric and energetic modeling.
	The most accurate MM force fields (with or without the CM4 charges
	substituted) were validated against gas-phase and aqueous-phase geometries
	and charge distributions of a larger set of 16 druglike ligands,
	both neutral and cationic. This process showed that the Merck Molecular
	Force Field (MMFF94) with or without CM4 charges substituted, is,
	on average, the most accurate force field for geometries of molecules
	containing nitrogen heterocycles and exocyclic amino groups, both
	protonated and unprotonated. This force field was then applied to
	the complete methotrexate molecule, in an effort to systematically
	explore its accuracy for trends in geometries and charge distributions.
	The most accurate force fields for the binding energies of nitrogen
	heterocycles to a water molecule are OPLS2005 and AMBER.},

	size have made it an attractive model system for computational and
	experimental studies of protein folding. Recent experimental studies
	have explored the denatured state of HP36 using fragment analysis
	coupled with relatively low-resolution spectroscopic techniques.
	These studies have shown that there is apparently only a small tendency
	to form locally stabilized secondary structure. Here, we complement
	the experimental studies by using replica exchange molecular dynamics
	with explicit solvent to investigate the structural features of these
	peptide models of unfolded HP36. To ensure convergence, two sets
	of simulations for each fragment were performed with different initial
	structures, and simulations were continued until these generated
	very similar final ensembles. These simulations reveal low populations
	of native-like structure and early folding events that cannot be
	resolved by experiment. For each fragment, calculated J-coupling
	constants and helical propensities are in good agreement with experimental
	trends. HP-1, corresponding to residues 41 to 53 and including the
	first alpha-helix, contains the highest helical population. HP-3,
	corresponding to residues 62 through 75 and including the third alpha-helix,
	contains a small population of helical turn residing at the N terminus
	while HP-2, corresponding to residues 52 through 61 and including
	the second alpha-helix, formed little to no structure in isolation.
	Overall, HP-1 was the only fragment to adopt a native-like conformation,

In this model the charge of each particle is represented by a point-charge surrounded by a Gaussian charge-cloud of opposite sign{,} thus four Coulombic terms (point-charge -- point-charge{,} point-charge -- charge-cloud{,} charge-cloud -- point-charge and charge-cloud -- charge-cloud) are required per atom pair. In this work it is demonstrated that the Gaussian charge distributions can be removed from the model after a minor modification of the overall atomic point-charges. Despite this substantial modification of the model{,} structural properties obtained via pair- and angle distributions remain largely unaffected and the change in dynamical properties (vibrational frequencies{,} proton transfer properties) was found to be minor. As an additional improvement an adjustment of the bending mode vibration was carried out by carefully evaluating the parametrization of the three-body interaction potential{,} thereby retaining the good agreement of the transfer properties of the aqueous excess proton reported in an earlier study. The proposed simple point-charge (SPC) type parametrization of the Coulombic interactions not only leads to a notable decrease in computational demand but generalizes the dissociative model by improving its transferability to established third-party simulation software and enabling the application of different theoretical approaches such as Ewald summation techniques not considered in the original parametrization. The outlined optimization strategy demonstrates that despite the complex and challenging formulation of the force field{,} various dynamical properties can be selectively adjusted without influencing other critical parameters of the simulated systems."}

  abstract = {The crystal structures of two double mutants (F14N/V21T and F14N/V86T)
	of the signal transduction protein CheY have been determined to a
	resolution of 2.4 and 2.2{\AA}, respectively. The structures were solved
	by molecular replacement and refined to final R values of 18.4 and
	19.2\%, respectively. Together with urea-denaturation experiments
	the structures have been used to analyse the effects of mutations
	where hydrophobic residues are replaced by residues capable of establishing
	hydrogen bonds. The large increase in stabilization (-12.1 kJ mol-1)
	of the mutation Phe14Asn arises from two factors: a reverse hydrophobic
	effect and the formation of a good N-cap at [alpha]-helix 1. In addition,
	a forward-backward hydrogen-bonding pattern, resembling an N-capping
	box and involving Asn14 and Arg18, has been found. The two Val to
	Thr mutations at the hydrophobic core have different thermodynamic
	effects: the mutation Val21Thr does not affect the stability of the
	protein while the mutation Val86Thr causes a small destabilization
	of 1.7 kJ mol-1. At site 21 a backward side-chain-to-backbone hydrogen
	bond is formed inside [alpha]-helix 1 with the carbonyl O atom of
	the i - 4 residue without movement of the mutated side chain. The
	destabilizing effect of introducing a polar group in the core is
	efficiently compensated for by the formation of an extra hydrogen
	bond. At site 86 the new O[gamma] atom escapes from the hydrophobic
	environment by a [chi]1 rotation into an adjacent hydrophilic cavity
	to form a new hydrogen bond. In this case the isosteric Val to Thr
	substitution is disruptive but the loss in stabilization energy is
	partly compensated by the formation of a hydrogen bond. The two crystal
	structures described in this work underline the significance of the
	hydrogen-bond component to protein stability.}

	Three single component aqueous solution aerosols (raffinose, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-DL-mandelic

  abstract = {The electrostatic energy component of classical force fields often
	includes some of the polarization energy component implicitly through
	the choice of atomic charges. In this and the subsequent articles
	we describe progress toward separating and accurately calculating
	both electrostatic and polarization energies. In the present contribution
	the distributed point charge representation of electrostatics is
	retained. Charges derived from several quantum chemical models including
	electron correlation at various levels are compared. We found that
	ignoring electron correlation in deriving charges for our force field
	can result in an error of several kcal mol-l in free energy difference
	simulations, and that this error can be comparable to the effect
	of ignoring polarization. We conclude that the accurate treatment
	of polarization in force fields also requires an accurate treatment
	of electron correlation. The work is based on the relatively new
	MPFIT charge fitting procedure (Ferenczy, G. G. J. Comput. Chem.
	1991, 12, 913; Chipot, C.; et. al. J. Phys. Chem. 1993, 97, 6628),
	which produces point charges comparable to conventional molecular
	electrostatic potential-derived charges. These new charges are slightly
	less polar and more transferable and contain more chemical sense,
	but they are still conformationally dependent. The significance of
	different levels of electron correlation in these charges was examined
	through regression analysis, to determine scaling relationships between
	the charges, and through free energy difference simulations, to determine
	the effect of using alternative charge sets. The free energy calculations
	indicate that the Becke-Lee, Yang, and Parr nonlocal density functional
	method gives charges similar to second-order Moller-Plessett perturbation
	theory. The charges are shown to be insensitive to the precision
	of the quadrature used in the density functional calculations. For
	polar molecules, these methods generally gave free energies of hydration
	which were significantly smaller than those computed using Hartree-Fock
	charges. When the Hartree-Fock charges are scaled to reproduce the
	higher quality charges, the error is usually reduced, but is still
	significant in some cases. Since many force fields effectively exploit
	the polarity of the Hartree-Fock charges to mimic the effects of
	polarization in an ad hoc way, this result has important implications
	for force field design, as mentioned above. It is suggested that
	the electron density calculated by the density functional method
	is a suitable starling point to derive distributed multipole sets
	for use in force fields which include explicit polarization. 1089-5639}

	to the hydration shell of the protein are remarkably small, between

	shielded in both the unfolded and folded conformations. The free
	energy changes for initial hydration of the folded +5 charge state
	are significantly more negative than for the unfolded +7 state. This

	including conformational changes, folding transitions, and translocations
	of ligands and reaction products, often correspond to high-level
	structural rearrangements that alter contacts between molecules or
	among different parts of a molecule. Due to advances in computer
	architecture and software, MD trajectories representing such structure-changing
	events have become easier to generate, but the length of these trajectories
	poses a challenge to scientific interpretation and analysis. In this
	paper, we present automated methods for the detection of potentially
	important structure-changing events in long MD trajectories. In contrast
	with traditional tools for the analysis of such trajectories, our
	methods provide a detailed report of broken and formed contacts that
	aids in the identification of specific time-dependent side-chain
	interactions. Our approach employs a coarse-grained representation
	of amino acid side chains, a contact metric based on higher order
	generalizations of Delaunay tetrahedralization, techniques for detecting
	significant shifts in the resulting contact time series, and a new
	kernel-based measure of contact alteration activity. The analysis
	methods we describe are incorporated in a newly developed package,
	called TimeScapes, which is freely available and compatible with
	trajectories generated by a variety of popular MD programs. Tests
	based on actual microsecond time scale simulations demonstrate that
	the package can be used to efficiently detect and characterize important

	quite well the experimental behavior of the protein under high pressure.
	The protein keeps its globular form, but adopts a different conformation
	with a very small reduction in volume. Some residues in the hydrophobic
	core become exposed to water and a large part of the secondary structure
	of the protein, (60\% of the sheet structure and 40\% of the helical
	structure) is denatured between 10 and 15 kbar. This is in good agreement
	with experimental data (Goossens, K., et al. Eur. J. Biochem, 236:254-262,
	1996) that show denaturation of BPTI between 8 and 14 kbar. A further
	increase of the pressure results in a freezing of the protein as
	deduced from the large decrease of the mobility of the residues.
	During the simulation, the normal structure of water changes from
	an ice Ih-like to an ice VI-like structure, while keeping the liquid
	state. The driving force of the high pressure induced conformational
	transition seems be the higher compressibility of the water compared

	and leads to penetration of the solvent into the hydrophobic core.}

This method defines a local region for each particle and describes the remaining region as images of the local region statistically distributed in an isotropic and periodic way, which we call isotropic periodic images. Different from lattice sum methods that sum over discrete lattice images generated by periodic boundary conditions, this method sums over the isotropic periodic images to calculate long-range interactions, and is referred to as the isotropic periodic sum (IPS) method. The IPS method is not a lattice sum method and eliminates the need for a reciprocal space sum. Several analytic solutions of IPS for commonly used potentials are presented. It is demonstrated that the IPS method produces results very similar to that of Ewald summation, but with three major advantages, (1) it eliminates unwanted symmetry artifacts raised from periodic boundary conditions, (2) it can be applied to potentials of any functional form and to fully and partially homogenous systems as well as finite systems, and (3) it is more computationally efficient and can be easily parallelized for multiprocessor computers. Therefore, this method provides a general approach to an efficient calculation of long-range interactions for various kinds of molecular systems.}

	that this effect is mainly due to the strength of intermolecular

	sensitive to the equilibrium bond angle via the distribution of intermolecular
	angles in the liquid: A larger bond angle will increase the angle
	formed by two molecular dipoles, which is particularly significant

	A new flexible simple point-charge water model was derived by optimizing

	the parametrization only slightly perturbs the molecular geometry

Three IPS models, 3D IPS, 2D IPS, and 1D IPS have been developed for three common types of homogeneous systems. Based on the fact that 3D IPS can well describe the long-range interactions of a heterogeneous system if a local region larger than the homogeneity scale is used, this work presents a method based on 3D IPS to calculate long-range interactions for all kinds of simulation systems, including homogeneous, heterogeneous, and finite systems. Unlike the original 3D IPS method that uses a local region defined by the cutoff distance, this method uses a local region larger than that defined by the cutoff distance to reach the homogeneity scale. To efficiently calculate interactions within such a large local region, this method split long-range interactions into two parts, a cutoff part and a long-range part. The cutoff part is calculated by summing over atom pairs within a cutoff range (about 10\AA), and the long-range part is calculated using the discrete fast Fourier transform (DFFT) technique. This method is applied to electrostatic and van der Waals interactions for both periodic and non-periodic systems. Example simulations demonstrate that this method can accurately and efficiently calculate long-range interactions for molecular simulation.}

  abstract =     {Isotropic periodic sum (IPS) is a method to calculate long-range interactions based on homogeneity of simulation systems. Long-range interactions are represented by interactions with isotropic periodic images of a defined local region and can be reduced to short ranged IPS potentials. The original electrostatic three-dimensional (3D)-IPS potential was derived based on a nonpolar homogeneous approximation and its application is limited to nonpolar or weak polar systems. This work derived a polar electrostatic 3D-IPS potential based on polar interactions. For the convenience of application, polynomial functions with rationalized coefficients are proposed for electrostatic and Lennard-Jones 3D-IPS potentials. Model systems of various polarities and several commonly used solvent systems are simulated to evaluate the 3D-IPS potentials. It is demonstrated that for polar systems the polar electrostatic 3D-IPS potential has much improved accuracy as compared to the nonpolar 3D-IPS potential. For homogeneous systems, the polar electrostatic 3D-IPS potential with a local region radius or cutoff distance of as small as 10 {\AA} can satisfactorily reproduce energetic, structural, and dynamic properties from the particle-meshed-Ewald method. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems, the 3D-IPS/discrete fast Fourier transform method using either the nonpolar or the polar electrostatic 3D-IPS potentials results in very similar simulation results.}

	The beta-hairpin of A beta(30-42) is converted into a turn-coil conformation
	when the last two hydrophobic residues are removed, suggesting that
	I41 and A42 are critical in stabilizing the beta-hairpin in A beta
	42-derived CTFs. The importance of solvent in determining the structure

The films were transiently heated with ∼10 ns infrared laser pulses, which produced typical heating and cooling rates of ∼109-1010 K/s. The crystallization of these water films was monitored with infrared spectroscopy. The experimental conditions were chosen to suppress ice nucleation at both the water/metal and water/vacuum interfaces. Furthermore, internal pressure increases due to curvature effects are precluded in these flat films. Therefore, the experiments were sensitive to the homogeneous ice nucleation rate from ∼210 to 225 K. The experiments show that Jmax, the maximum for the homogeneous ice nucleation rate, J(T), needs to be ≥1026 m-3 s-1 and is likely to be ∼1029±2 m-3 s-1. We argue that such large nucleation rates are consistent with experiments on hyperquenched glassy water, which typically have crystalline fractions of ∼1\% or more. }

abstract = {It is often desirable to accurately and efficiently model the behavior of large molecular systems in the condensed phase (thousands to tens of thousands of atoms) over long time scales (from nanoseconds to milliseconds). In these cases, ab initio methods are difficult due to the increasing computational cost with the number of electrons. A more computationally attractive alternative is to perform the simulations at the atomic level using a parameterized function to model the electronic energy. Many empirical force fields have been developed for this purpose. However, the functions that are used to model interatomic and intermolecular interactions contain many fitted parameters obtained from selected model systems, and such classical force fields cannot properly simulate important electronic effects. Furthermore, while such force fields are computationally affordable, they are not reliable when applied to systems that differ significantly from those used in their parameterization. They also cannot provide the information necessary to analyze the interactions that occur in the system, making the systematic improvement of the functional forms that are used difficult. Ab initio force field methods aim to combine the merits of both types of methods. The ideal ab initio force fields are built on first principles and require no fitted parameters. Ab initio force field methods surveyed in this perspective are based on fragmentation approaches and intermolecular perturbation theory. This perspective summarizes their theoretical foundation, key components in their formulation, and discusses key aspects of these methods such as accuracy and formal computational cost. The ab initio force fields considered here were developed for different targets, and this perspective also aims to provide a balanced presentation of their strengths and shortcomings. Finally, this perspective suggests some future directions for this actively developing area.

  abstract = {Side-chain 2H and backbone 15N relaxation data have been collected
	at multiple temperatures in the samples of the SH3 domain from R-spectrin.
	Combined analyses of the data allowed for determination of the temperature-dependent
	correlation times Xf characterizing fast methyl motion. Molecular
	dynamics simulations confirmed that Xf are dominated by methyl rotation;
	the corresponding activation energies approximate methyl rotation
	barriers. For 33 methyl groups in the R-spectrin SH3 domain the average
	barrier height was thus determined to be 2.8 ( 0.9 kcal/mol. This
	value is deemed representative of the 'fluid' hydrophobic protein
	core where some barriers are increased and others are lowered because
	of the contacts with surrounding atoms, but there is no local order
	that could produce systematically higher (lower) barriers. For comparison,
	the MD simulation predicts the average barrier of 3.1 kcal/mol (calculated
	via the potential of mean force) or 3.4-3.5 kcal/mol (rigid barriers
	after appropriate averaging over multiple MD snapshots). The latter
	result prompted us to investigate rigid methyl rotation barriers
	in a series of NMR structures from the Protein Databank. In most
	cases the barriers proved to be higher than expected, 4-6 kcal/mol.
	To a certain degree, this is caused by tight packing of the side
	chains in the NMR structures and stems from the structure calculation
	procedure where the coordinates are first annealed toward the temperature
	of 0 K and then subjected to energy minimization. In several cases
	the barriers >10 kcal/mol are indicative of van der Waals violations.
	The notable exceptions are (i) the structures solved using the GROMOS
	force field where tight methyl packing is avoided (3.0-3.6 kcal/mol)
	and (ii) the structure solved by means of the dynamic ensemble refinement
	method (Lindorff-Larsen, K.; Best, R. B.; DePristo, M. A.; Dobson,
	C. M.; Vendruscolo, M. Nature 2005, 433, 128) (3.5 kcal/mol). These
	results demonstrate that methyl rotation barriers, derived from the
	experiments that are traditionally associated with studies of protein
	dynamics, can be also used in the context of structural work. This
	is particularly interesting in view of the recent efforts to incorporate
	dynamics data in the process of protein structure elucidation.},

The essential idea is that the convergence of the relevant measure (e.g., the free energy derivative in thermodynamic integration) is monitored in the reverse direction starting from the last frame of the trajectory, instead of the usual approach, which begins with the first frame and goes in the forward direction. This simple change in the use of the simulation data makes it straightforward to eliminate the contamination of the averages by contributions from the equilibrating region. A statistical criterion is introduced for distinguishing the equilibrated (production) region from the equilibrating region. The proposed method, called reverse cumulative averaging, is illustrated by its application to the well-studied case of the alchemical free energy simulation of ethane to methanol."

abstract = { Accurate molecular simulation of aqueous ionic solutions is arguably one of the most important challenges in modern physical chemistry with far-reaching implications in various other areas of science. At the same time, molecular dynamics simulation of prototypical NaCl solution remains highly challenging partly because there exist two distinct minima in the free energy profile, corresponding to the so-called solvent-shared ion pair and the contact ion pair. Accurate description of NaCl free energy profile remains quite challenging at the standard GGA level of density functional theory in first-principles molecular dynamics, and development of better force fields for classical molecular dynamics simulations also suffer from having limited information available on the extent to which charge transfer is important. In this work, we employ two recent advanced exchange-correlation (XC) approximations, ωB97X-V and SCAN, in first-principles molecular dynamics for simulating NaCl ion pair in water. In particular, we calculate the potential of mean force to study relative stability of the solvent-shared ion pair and the contact ion pair. We also discuss how electronic structure of water molecules and ions depend on the XC approximations. Our work shows that simulations of water and aqueous ionic solution will benefit greatly from employing these two advanced XC functionals in first-principles molecular dynamics simulation. }

  journal = BTpcb,
  year = {2010},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have become an essential tool to study
	a large variety of biomolecular processes, exploring temporal and
	spatial scales inaccessible to traditional models of atomistic resolution.
	One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation
	of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as
	a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a
	proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment,
	is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent
	in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties
	derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable
	coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG
	MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water
	molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real
	water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence
	that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the
	same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water
	density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level
	of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the
	new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate.
	First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane.
	The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally
	feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric
	aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the
	second application we consider the electroporation process of both
	an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the
	formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar
	mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models.},

  abstract = {G-peptide is a 16-residue peptide of the C-terminal end of streptococcal

	within 6 Vs. Here, we study molecular mechanism on the stability
	and folding of G-peptide by performing a, multicanonical. replica-exchange
	(MUCAREM) molecular dynamics simulation with explicit solvent. Unlike
	the preceding simulations of the same peptide, the simulation was
	started from an unfolded conformation without any experimental information
	on the native conformation. In the 278-ns trajectory, we observed
	three independent folding events. Thus MUCAREM can be estimated to
	accelerate the folding reaction more than 60 times than the conventional
	molecular dynamics simulations. The free-energy landscape of the
	peptide at room temperature shows that there are three essential
	subevents in the folding pathway to construct the native-like P-hairpin
	conformation: (i) a hydrophobic collapse of the peptide occurs with
	the side-chain contacts between Tyr45 and Phe52, (ii) then, the native-like
	turn is formed accompanying with the hydrogen-bonded network around
	the turn region, and (iii) finally, the rest of the backbone hydrogen
	bonds are formed. A number of stable native hydrogen bonds are formed
	cooperatively during the second stage, suggesting the importance
	of the formation of the specific turn structure. This is also supported
	by the accumulation of the nonnative conformations only with the
	hydrophobic cluster around Tyr45 and Phe52. These simulation results
	are consistent with high Phi-values of the turn region observed by

	water clusters. The primary focus is given to the surface versus
	interior solvation behavior of the anions. To this end, various combinations
	of polarizable/nonpolarizable water and anion models were considered.
	Using the nonpolarizable TIP4P water with polarizable Cl- and Br-
	models, the Cl- is fully solvated inside the (H2O)(60) cluster, whereas
	the Br- is partially solvated at the surface of the cluster. However,
	when the polarizability of the Br- is turned off, the ``Br-'' anion
	is fully solvated. Using the polarizable Dang-Chang water, both Cl-
	and Br- reside at the surface of (H2O)(60) as well as (H2O)(500)
	clusters, consistent with the finding of Stuart and Berne [J. Phys.
	Chem. 100, 11934 (1996)] based on the polarizable TIP4P-FQ water
	with the polarizable Drude halide model. When the polarizabilities
	of the halide anions are turned off, the smaller size ``Cl-'' anion
	is fully solvated in the interior of the Dang-Chang water cluster,
	whereas the larger ``Br-'' anion is still partially solvated at the
	surface of the cluster, indicating the importance of the anion-size
	effect. We have also calculated the free energy change for the Cl-
	moving from the center of a lamella water slab to the surface. The
	free-energy change is on the order of 1 kcal/mol, indicating that
	the Cl- can easily access the surface region of the Dang-Chang water

  abstract = {Natural gas is projected to be the premium fuel of the 21st century
	because of availability, as well as economical and environmental
	considerations. Natural gas is coproduced with water from the subsurface
	forming gas hydrates. Hydrate formation may result in shutdown of
	onshore and offshore operations. Industry practice has been usage
	of alcohols-which have undesirable environmental impacts-to affect
	bulk-phase properties and inhibit hydrate formation. An alternative
	to alcohols is changing the surface properties through usage of polymers
	and surfactants, effective at 0.5-3 wt \% of coproduced water. One
	group of low-dosage hydrate inhibitors (LDHI) are kinetic inhibitors,
	which affect nucleation rate and growth. A second group of LDHI are
	anti-agglomerants, which prevent agglomeration of small hydrate crystallites.
	Despite great potential, reported work on hydrate anti-agglomeration
	is very limited. In this paper, our focus is on the use of two vastly
	different surfactants As anti - agglomerants. We use a model oil,
	water, and tetrahydrofuran as a hydrate-forming species. We examine
	the effectiveness of a quaternary ammonium salt (i.e., quat). Visual
	observation measurements show that a small concentration of the quat
	(0.01\%) can prevent agglomeration. However, a quat is not a green
	chemical and therefore may be undesirable. We show that a rhamnolipid
	biosurfactant can be effective to a concentration of 0.05 wt \%.
	One difference between the two surfactants is the stability of the
	water-in-oil emulsions created. The biosurfactant forms a less stable
	emulsion, which makes it very desirable for hydrate application.

	is presented of the mechanisms determining the ultimate coverage
	based on the energetics of interaction of the particles with one
	another and with the adsorbent surface. In particular, two limiting
	cases are identified. In the first, in which adsorption is irreversible,
	the coverage is determined largely by interparticle repulsion, and
	can be modelled by a variant of the random sequential adsorption
	(RSA) approach; this leads to a prediction of increasing coverage
	with increasing ionic strength. In the second limiting situation
	the particle-surface interactions are weaker and may be attenuated
	by increasing ionic strength, leading to-a more complex balance with
	interparticle interactions. The situation is modelled using a mechanistically
	based isotherm in which various trends with both particle and salt
	concentration are possible. The first limiting case tends to occur
	more frequently with larger particles and the second with smaller
	ones such as proteins. Experimental data are presented in the intermediate
	range for the large globular protein catalase adsorbed on negatively
	charged self-assembled monolayers (SAM), which was studied by liquid
	tapping mode atomic force microscopy (LTM-AFM). The influence of
	increasing ionic strength on surface coverage varies, showing increasing
	coverage at low ionic strength, then a drop at intermediate ionic
	strength, and another increase at high ionic strength. The initial
	increase is interpreted as being consistent with the modified RSA
	mechanism and the subsequent decrease with screening of particle-surface
	attraction in the isotherm model, while the final increase is thought
	to be caused by depletion forces. The results indicate the potential

	adducts and matrix clusters were observed for the matrix CCA pyridine
	in the molar ratio 2:1. The optimized ionic liquid matrix was used
	for identification of tryptic digests of six model proteins and for
	identification of a protein extracted from a two-dimensional gel

	that comparisons made at one distance only are of limited value.
	At large distances the coulombic and van der Waals 1/r(6) empirical
	terms correspond fairly well with the DFT-SAPT electrostatics and

	The HB orientations are in good agreement with available experimental

Surprisingly, the contact angle of a water droplet on the MgO surface is not a linear function of temperature. To further probe this phenomenon, we obtain the radial distribution functions, atomic density profiles, the orientation of OH bonds, and a hydrogen bond network in the first hydration layer at different temperatures. We find that the atomic structures change as temperature increases in the first hydration layer. In order to discover the governing factors, we investigate the reason why the density of hydrogen bonds decreases as temperature rises and analyze its effects on the water wettability of the MgO surface. }

abstract  ="Many methods for correcting harmonic partition functions for the presence of torsional motions employ some form of one-dimensional torsional treatment to replace the harmonic contribution of a specific normal mode. However{,} torsions are often strongly coupled to other degrees of freedom{,} especially other torsions and low-frequency bending motions{,} and this coupling can make assigning torsions to specific normal modes problematic. Here{,} we present a new class of methods{,} called multi-structural (MS) methods{,} that circumvents the need for such assignments by instead adjusting the harmonic results by torsional correction factors that are determined using internal coordinates. We present three versions of the MS method: (i) MS-AS based on including all structures (AS){,} i.e.{,} all conformers generated by internal rotations; (ii) MS-ASCB based on all structures augmented with explicit conformational barrier (CB) information{,} i.e.{,} including explicit calculations of all barrier heights for internal-rotation barriers between the conformers; and (iii) MS-RS based on including all conformers generated from a reference structure (RS) by independent torsions. In the MS-AS scheme{,} one has two options for obtaining the local periodicity parameters{,} one based on consideration of the nearly separable limit and one based on strongly coupled torsions. The latter involves assigning the local periodicities on the basis of Voronoi volumes. The methods are illustrated with calculations for ethanol{,} 1-butanol{,} and 1-pentyl radical as well as two one-dimensional torsional potentials. The MS-AS method is particularly interesting because it does not require any information about conformational barriers or about the paths that connect the various structures."}

The program can also carry out calculations in the multiple-structure local harmonic approximation. The program package also includes six utility codes that can be used as stand-alone programs to calculate reduced moment of inertia matrices by the method of Kilpatrick and Pitzer, to generate conformational structures, to calculate, either analytically or by Monte Carlo sampling, volumes for torsional subdomains defined by Voronoi tessellation of the conformational subspace, to generate template input files, and to calculate one-dimensional torsional partition functions using the torsional eigenvalue summation method.

The predictions were in poor agreement with experiment, and we conjectured that much of the error might derive from the force field, CHARMm with Vcharge charges. Repeating the calculations with other generalized force-fields led to no significant improvement, and we observed that the predicted affinities were highly sensitive to the choice of force-field. We therefore embarked on a systematic evaluation of a set of generalized force fields, based upon comparisons with PM6-DH2, a fast yet accu- rate semi-empirical quantum mechanics method. In par- ticular, we compared gas-phase interaction energies and entropies for the host-guest complexes themselves, as well as for smaller chemical fragments derived from the same molecules. The mean deviations of the force field interac- tion energies from the quantum results were greater than 3 kcal/mol and 9 kcal/mol, for the fragments and host- guest systems respectively. We further evaluated the accuracy of force-fields for computing the vibrational entropies and found the mean errors to be greater than 4 kcal/mol. Given these errors in energy and entropy, it is not surprising in retrospect that the predicted binding affinities deviated from the experiment by several kcal/ mol. These results emphasize the need for improvements in generalized force-fields and also highlight the importance of systematic evaluation of force-field parameters prior to evaluating different free-energy methods.}}

We show that the Hessian matrix of second derivatives built by a quasi-Newton optimizer during geometry optimization of a molecule with a classical molecular potential in these three environments can be used to predict vibrational entropies. We also show that a simple analytical solvation model allows for no less accurate entropy estimation of molecules in solution than a physically rigorous but computationally more expensive model based on Poisson’s equation. Our work also suggests that scaled particle theory more precisely estimates the hydrophobic part of solvation entropy than the using a simple surface area term.}

Abstract = {{In the present study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans assay system to
   investigate in vivo toxicity from clentuberol and ractopamine and the
   possible underlying mechanism. Both acute and prolonged exposures to
   clentuberol or ractopamine decreased brood size and locomotion behavior,
   and induced intestinal autofluorescence and reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) production. Although acute exposure to the examined concentrations
   of clentuberol or ractopamine did not induce lethality, prolonged
   exposure to 10 mu g/L of clentuberol and ractopamine reduced lifespan.
   At relatively high concentrations, ractopamine exhibited more severe
   toxicity than clentuberol on nematodes. Overexpression of sod-2 gene
   encoding a Mn-SOD to prevent induction of oxidative stress effectively
   inhibited toxicity from clentuberol or ractopamine. Besides oxidative
   stress, we found that clentuberol might reduce lifespan through
   influencing insulin/IGF signaling pathway; however, ractopamine might
   reduce lifespan through affecting both insulin/IGF signaling pathway and
   TOR signaling pathway. Ractopamine more severely decreased expression
   levels of daf-16, sgk-1, skn-1, and aak-2 genes than clentuberol, and
   increased expression levels of daf-2 and age-1 genes at the examined
   concentration. Therefore, the C. elegans assay system may be useful for
   assessing the possible toxicity from weight loss agents, and clentuberol
   and ractopamine may induce toxicity through different molecular
   mechanisms.}},

	and structure of these droplets. We also followed the gas-phase formation
	of hydronium and glycine homologue ions from the disintegrating nanodroplets.
	Droplets up to 6.5 nm in diameter were studied using potentials for
	the peptides and water that accounted for their internal degrees
	of freedom. Validity testing of the model indicated good agreement
	between the calculated radial distribution functions for water and
	corresponding neutron diffraction data. The selfdiffusion coefficients
	and the enthalpy of evaporation derived from the model also gave
	good agreement with the experimental values. Our results showed that
	the ions were distributed in concentric layers within the droplet.
	This is a departure from the expectation that ions inside the droplet
	follow a monotonic radial distribution close to the surface because
	of the Coulomb repulsion and/or hydrophobic forces. Due to the presence
	of ions in the droplet, both overall shape deformations and enhanced
	surface fluctuations were observed. Charge reduction at the Rayleigh
	limit proceeded through the formation of transient surface protrusions.
	For droplets containing ions, amplitude protrusions higher than in
	the case of pure water droplets developed. These protrusions served
	as the intermediate stage preceding ion ejection. The evaporated
	ions detached from the droplet with a solvation shell of approximately
	10 water molecules per ion. Our data were coherent with the solvated
	ion evaporation model for droplets close to the Rayleigh limit. To
	the best of our knowledge, these are the first molecular dynamics
	calculations on realistic charged nanodroplets to give insight into
	their structure and fission dynamics.}

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for ethanolamine
	as a pure liquid and in aqueous solution at 298 and 333 K. The ethanolamine
	force field has been parametrized to reproduce intramolecular energies
	from quantum mechanical calculations and experimentally determined
	properties of the liquid. The results are presented for conformer
	distributions, density, enthalpy of vaporization, self-diffusion
	constant, dielectric constant, and radial distribution functions.
	The results strongly suggest that the main (O-C-C-N) dihedral tends
	to stay in its gauche conformers in solution and that the ethanolamine
	molecules populate conformers with a significant degree of intramolecular
	hydrogen bonding. This result is also supported by results from a
	continuum solvation model. Simulation of a 10 mol \% aqueous ethanolamine
	system suggests that ethanolamine is preferentially solvated to by
	water molecules. The results suggest that ethanolamine dimer formation
	in aqueous solution is very limited. Simulations were also carried
	out for CO2 in an aqueous ethanolamine system. The results suggest
	that CO2 has a comparable level of attraction to ethanolamine and
	water. The degree of interaction between CO2 and the amine and alcohol
	functionalities in ethanolamine also appear to be of comparable strength.

	To investigate this latter reaction, we determined X-ray structures
	of complexes of HheC with the favored and unfavored enantiomers of
	para-nitrostyrene oxide. The aromatic parts of the two enantiomers
	bind in a very similar way, but the epoxide ring of the unfavored
	(S)-enantiomer binds in a nonproductive inverted manner, with the
	epoxide oxygen and C beta atom positions interchanged with respect
	to those of the favored (R)-enantiomer. The calculated difference
	in relative Gibbs binding energy is in agreement with the observed
	loss of a single hydrogen bond in the S bound state with respect
	to the R bound state. Our results indicate that it is the nonproductive
	binding of the unfavored (S)-enantiomer, rather than the difference
	in affinity for the two enantiomers, that allows HheC to catalyze
	the azide-mediated ring opening of para-nitrostyrene oxide with high
	enantioselectivity. This work represents a rare opportunity to explain
	the enantioselectivity of an enzymatic reaction by comparison of
	crystallographic data on the binding of both the favored and unfavored
	enantiomers. 0002-7863}

	discovery in the 1970s that several thermodynamic and transport properties
	of supercooled water exhibit a pronounced temperature dependence
	and appear to diverge slightly below the homogeneous nucleation temperature
	inspired a large number of experimental and theoretical studies.
	Likewise, an important body of work on glassy water has been stimulated
	by experiments, starting in the mid-1980s and continuing to this
	date, which suggest that vitreous water can exist in at least two
	apparently distinct forms. Acoherent theory of the thermodynamic
	and transport properties of supercooled and glassy water does not
	yet exist. Nevertheless, significant progress towards this goal has
	been made during the past 20 years. This article summarizes the known
	experimental facts and reviews critically theoretical and computational
	work aimed at interpreting the observations and providing a unified
	viewpoint on cold, non-crystalline, metastable states of water.}

	indicates that shifts in the average potential energy are equivalent
	to rising the temperature about 80 K and are therefore non-negligible.
	The energy shifts due to quantization and the quantum mechanical
	uncertainties observed in ice are smaller than the values previously

  pages = {54512},
  abstract = {This paper explores the influence of choice of potential model on
	the quantum effects observed in liquid water and ice. This study
	utilizes standard rigid models and a more formal context for the
	rigid-body centroid molecular dynamics methodology used to perform
	the quantum simulations is provided. Quantum and classical molecular
	dynamics simulations are carried out for liquid water and ice Ih
	at 298 and 220 K, respectively, with the simple point charge/extended
	and TIP4P-Ew water models. The results obtained for equilibrium and
	dynamical properties are compared with those recently reported on
	TIP4P [L. Hernandez de la Pena and P. G. Kusalik, J. Chem. Phys.
	121, 5992 (2004); L. Hernandez de la Pena , J. Chem. Phys 123, 144506
	(2005)]. For the liquid, an energy shift of about 8\% and an average
	molecular uncertainty of about 11 degrees were found independently
	of the water model. The self-diffusion coefficient consistently increases
	by more than 50\% when going from the classical to the quantum system
	and quantum dynamics are found to reproduce the experimental isotopic
	shifts with the models examined. The ice results compare remarkably
	well with those previously reported for the TIP4P water model; they
	confirm that quantum effects are considerable and that the quantum
	mechanical uncertainty and the energy shifts due to quantization
	are smaller in ice than in liquid water. The relevance of these findings
	in the context of the construction of water models is briefly discussed.

	developed for use in ultrashort laser-produced plasma research. The
	streak camera presented here \~{}called PX1! has been extensively
	characterized with continuous and pulsed x-ray sources. Time resolution
	of 350 fs in the keV x-ray range has been achieved, while maintaining
	a high spatial resolution of 40 mm along a direction perpendicular
	to the time dispersion axis. It is shown that the streak camera response
	is lower when the photocathode is illuminated by a pulsed source
	than when used with a continuous one. This effect seems to be related
	to a change in the phosphor response. The camera has been used to
	achieve high-resolution subpicosecond time-resolved spectroscopy
	of ultrashort laser plasmas allowing the measurements of K-shell
	line emission durations of 700 fs.}

	fails in the case of fast cooling rates for both NM and AGS expressions.
	Several attempts to provide more freedom to the fitting procedure

	We quantify structural order by orientational and translational order

	increase. At T=0 K, the glasses fall on a line in the Q- plane or

	upon isothermal compression and are able to identify distinct regions
	in the order map corresponding to these glasses. Comparison of the
	order parameters for LDA and HDA with those obtained upon isochoric
	cooling indicates major structural differences between glasses obtained

	using mono- disperse DOP (di-octyl phthalate) particles of 0.53,

	are in good agreement with the Gaussian distributions predicted by
	Boltzmann's law. Additionally, the ratio of charged and uncharged
	particles was measured using monodisperse NaC1 and methylene blue
	particles between 0.02 and 0.2 am diameter. The result was compared
	with the theories of Bricard, Fuchs, and Natanson as well as with
	continuum and free molecular theories and values predicted by Boltzmann's

  abstract = {A number of crystal structures of water have been superheated in Monte

	namely the TIP4P model and the SPC/E model. By comparing the uid
	solid coexistence temperature to the temperature at which the solid
	becomes mechanically unstable and melts it is possible to determine
	the typical range of temperatures over which it is possible to superheat
	the ice phases in conventional simulation studies. It is found that
	the ice phases can be superheated to approximately 90K beyond the
	uid solid coexistence temperature. Beyond this limit they spontaneously
	melt. This limit appears to depend weakly both on the type of ice
	phase considered and on the chosen model. Obviously only rigorous
	free energy calculations can determine the equilibrium uid solid

	solid water which differ in density and second nearest-neighbor oxygen--oxygen
	distribution. (a) The lower density form, made at 77 $^o$K, has a diffraction
	pattern consistent with a structure that has oxygen--oxygen nearest-neighbor
	tetrahedral symmetry on average, and a nearest neighbor O--O separation
	of 2.76 {{\AA}} with small dispersion. The density of this material
	is estimated to be 0.94 g cm--3. While it is not possible to uniquely
	define the structure, the data available support the notion that
	its fundamental characteristic is the existence of a randomized network
	of hydrogen bonds with O--O--O angular distribution derived from
	(i.e., centered about) that of ice Ih. Comparison of neutron diffraction
	and x-ray diffraction data suggests strongly that the first shell
	hydrogen bonds are nearly linear and that orientational correlations
	between water molecules are limited to nearest neighbors. (b) The
	higher density form, made at 10 $^o$K, has a diffraction pattern similar
	to, yet distinctively different from, that of the high temperature
	deposit. The O--O nearest neighbor distance is the same, 2.76 {{\AA}},
	but the dispersion in this separation is larger in the low temperature
	form. The diffraction pattern shows an extra peak at 3.3 {{\AA}},
	corresponding to about 1.4 molecules, the existence of which is responsible
	for the estimated higher density, namely 1.1 g cm--3. The data are
	consistent with several models which share the feature of introducing
	small O--O--O angles into the structure. We discuss the relationships
	between our data, and inferences from the data, and the corresponding
	data for liquid water.}

	a crystalline structure, namely, diamond cubic which is the metastable

	In order to elucidate the local order in the latter, a comparison
	is made between the experimental curves and the diffraction functions
	calculated for various noncrystalline models. The best agreement
	is obtained with a model which presents distorted rings of three
	to six H2O molecules, constructed by cooling a liquid water droplet
	through a molecular dynamics calculation. In particular, this means
	that the regular dodecahedral structure often referred to in mass
	spectroscopy is not a realistic model for neutral clusters. The Journal

  abstract = {Water exhibits a maximum in density at normal pressure at 4$^o$ above
	its melting point. The reproduction of this maximum is a stringent
	test for potential models used commonly in simulations of water.
	The relation between the melting temperature and the temperature
	of maximum density for these potential models is unknown mainly due
	to our ignorance about the melting temperature of these models. Recently
	we have determined the melting temperature of ice Ih for several
	commonlyx used models of water SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P/Ew,
	and TIP5P . In this work we locate the temperature of maximum density
	for these models. In this way the relative location of the temperature
	of maximum density with respect to the melting temperature is established.
	For SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P, TIP4P, and TIP4P/Ew the maximum in density
	occurs at about 21 37 K above the melting temperature. In all these
	models the negative charge is located either on the oxygen itself
	or on a point along the H O H bisector. For the TIP5P and TIP5P-E
	models the maximum in density occurs at about 11 K above the melting
	temperature. The location of the negative charge appears as a geometrical
	crucial factor to the relative position of the temperature of maximum
	density with respect to the melting temperature.}

  abstract = {Recently, experimental and theoretical studies on the water system
	are very active and noticeable. A transferable intermolecular potential
	seven points approach including fluctuation charges and flexible
	body (ABEEM-7P) based on a combination of the atom-bond electronegativity
	equalization and molecular mechanics (ABEEM/MM), and its application
	to small water clusters are explored and tested in this paper. The
	consistent combination of ABEEM and molecular mechanics (MM) is to
	take the ABEEM charges of atoms, bonds, and lone-pair electrons into
	the intermolecular electrostatic interaction term in molecular mechanics.
	To examine the charge transfer we have used two models coming from
	the charge constraint types: one is a charge neutrality constraint
	on whole water system and the other is on each water molecule. Compared
	with previous water force fields, the ABEEM-7P model has two characters:
	(1) the ABEEM-7P model not only presents the electrostatic interaction
	of atoms, bonds and lone-pair electrons and their changing in respond
	to different ambient environment but also introduces ``the hydrogen
	bond interaction region'' in which a new parameter klp,H(Rlp,H) is
	used to describe the electrostatic interaction of the lone-pair electron
	and the hydrogen atom which can form the hydrogen bond; (2) nonrigid
	but flexible water body permitting the vibration of the bond length
	and angle is allowed due to the combination of ABEEM and molecular
	mechanics, and for van der Waals interaction the ABEEM-7P model takes
	an all atom-atom interaction, i.e., oxygen-oxygen, hydrogen-hydrogen,
	oxygen-hydrogen interaction into account. The ABEEM-7P model based
	on ABEEM/MM gives quite accurate predictions for gas-phase state
	properties of the small water clusters (H2O)n (n = 2-6), such as
	optimized geometries, monomer dipole moments, vibrational frequencies,
	and cluster interaction energies. Due to its explicit description
	of charges and the hydrogen bond, the ABEEM-7P model will be applied
	to discuss properties of liquid water, ice, aqueous solutions, and
	biological systems.}

  abstract = {We have developed a microwave spectroscopy that can be applied to
	various fluids under high temperature and high pressure in the frequency
	range up to 40 GHz. By utilizing this new technique, we have measured
	the static dielectric constant and the dielectric relaxation time
	for water, heavy water, methanol in wide density ranges including
	their supercritical conditions. To interpret the observed temperature
	and density dependence of the relaxation time tau(D) for H2O and
	D2O, we have divided the fluid phase into three regimes: (1) gaseous
	state, (2) high temperature liquid and (3) low temperature liquid,
	In the first regime, where the hydrogen bond is of little importance,
	tau(D) is Simply expressed by the binary collision time, implying
	that the molecular orientation cannot be changed by the applied electric
	field as far as the molecule is rotating. In the second regime, the
	contribution of bound molecules that are incorporated in the hydrogen-bond
	(HB) network should be taken into account. The relaxation time of
	the bound molecule is longer than that of the free one by the time
	tau(B) that is required to escape from the HB networks and tau(B)
	can be described by the librational frequency and the HB enthalpy.
	In the third regime the escape time should be enhanced from tau(B)
	because some molecules once separated from the FIB network could
	be recaptured by it. These three relaxation regimes have been also
	confirmed for methanol. It is found that, when the inter-molecular
	stretching frequency is used in place of the librational one in the
	second regime, the degree of hydrogen bonding estimated from the
	NMR chemical shift can be correctly predicted from the observed tau(D).}

aging and cancer in living beings. Luckily, a repair enzyme is able to
repair the oxidized bases. The key step is to accurately recognize the
oxidized bases, which mainly rely on complex hydrogen bond
interactions. We have calibrated the charge parameters and torsional
parameters of the ABEEMσπ polarization force field (ABEEMσπ
PFF) to accurately describe the intermolecular and intramolecular
interactions. Taking the experiment and quantum chemical method
as the benchmark, a series of properties of base pair-amino acid
residue systems, DNA and DNA−protein interaction systems were calculated and compared with those of other force fields. We have done a tremendous amount of tasks in testing, calibrations, and analyses. The ABEEMσπ PFF not only explicitly gives the position and the partial charge of lone-pair electrons but also introduces a function kHB to fit special electrostatic interactions in hydrogen bond interaction regions. Therefore, it can accurately simulate the polarization effect and charge transfer of hydrogen bond interactions, especially for charged systems and sulfur-containing systems, such as the binding energy between amino acid and base pairs (24−28 kcal/mol), which is induced by charge transfer. The RMSD of ABEEMσπ PFF is 1.18 kcal/mol, whereas the RMSD of Amber OL15 is 8.21 kcal/mol. The relative positions of the amino acid residue have significantly changed, and the hydrogen bonds were broken when simulated by fixed charge force fields. In addition, owing to refitting the reasonable torsional parameters, the geometric structures optimized by ABEEMσπ PFF were well consistent with those of the M06-2X/6-311++G** method, but the simulations by fixed force fields have a large rotation of methyl and distortion of the plane of the base pair. After extensive MD simulation with four test DNAs and a DNA−protein system, we conclude that ABEEMσπ PFF shows better agreement when compared to experimental structures, which illustrates the reliability of our model and the transferability of the parameters.}

For each isomer, we extrapolated the RI-MP2 energies to their complete basis set limit, included a CCSD(T) correction using a smaller basis set and added finite temperature corrections within the rigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator (RRHO) model using scaled and unscaled harmonic vibrational frequencies. The vibrational scaling factors were determined specifically for water clusters by comparing harmonic frequencies with VPT2 fundamental frequencies. We find the CCSD(T) correction to the RI-MP2 binding energy to be small (<1\%) but still important in determining accurate conformational energies. Anharmonic corrections are found to be non-negligble; they do not alter the energetic ordering of isomers, but they do lower the free energies of formation of the water clusters by as much as 4 kcal/mol at 298.15 K.}}

Machine learning (ML) methods are emerging as a powerful approach to constructing various forms of transferable atomistic potentials. They have been successfully applied in a variety of applications in chemistry, biology, catalysis, and solid-state physics. However, these models are heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of data used in their fitting. Fitting highly flexible ML potentials, such as neural networks, comes at a cost: a vast amount of reference data is required to properly train these models. We address this need by providing access to a large computational DFT database, which consists of more than 20 M off equilibrium conformations for 57,462 small organic molecules. We believe it will become a new standard benchmark for comparison of current and future methods in the ML potential community.}

abstract  ="Deep learning is revolutionizing many areas of science and technology{,} especially image{,} text{,} and speech recognition. In this paper{,} we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI for short. ANI is a new method designed with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that utilize a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV) as a molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space{,} a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1{,} which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H{,} C{,} N{,} and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces{,} we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies{,} we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set."}

abstract = {The development of accurate and transferable machine learning (ML) potentials for predicting molecular energetics is a challenging task. The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble’s prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential achieves a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecules or materials, while remaining applicable to the general class of organic molecules composed of the elements CHNO.

abstract="For quantitative description of a molecular charge distribution it is convenient to dissect the molecule into well-defined atomic fragments. A general and natural choice is to share the charge density at each point among the several atoms in proportion to their free-atom densities at the corresponding distances from the nuclei. This prescription yields well-localized bonded-atom distributions each of which closely resembles the molecular density in its vicinity. Integration of the atomic deformation densities --- bonded minus free atoms --- defines net atomic charges and multipole moments which concisely summarize the molecular charge reorganization. They permit calculation of the external electrostatic potential and of the interaction energy between molecules or between parts of the same molecule. Sample results for several molecules indicate a high transferability of net atomic charges and moments.",

  OPTabstract = {An alternative to the Gaussian-n (G1, G2, and G3) composite methods of computing molecular energies is proposed and is named the “correlation consistent composite approach” (ccCA, ccCA-CBS-1, ccCA-CBS-2). This approach uses the correlation consistent polarized valence (cc-pVXZ) basis sets. The G2-1 test set of 48 enthalpies of formation (ΔHf), 38 adiabatic ionization potentials (IPs), 25 adiabatic electron affinities (EAs), and 8 adiabatic proton affinities (PAs) are computed using this approach, as well as the ΔHf values of 30 more systems. Equilibrium molecular geometries and vibrational frequencies are obtained using B3LYP density functional theory. When applying the ccCA-CBS method with the cc-pVXZ series of basis sets augmented with diffuse functions, mean absolute deviations within the G2-1 test set compared to experiment are 1.33kcalmol−1 for ΔHf,0.81kcalmol−1 for IPs, 1.02kcalmol−1 for EAs, and 1.51kcalmol−1 for PAs, without including the “high-level correction” (HLC) contained in the original Gn methods. Whereas the HLC originated in the Gaussian-1 method as an isogyric correction, it evolved into a fitted parameter that minimized the error of the composite methods, eliminating its physical meaning. Recomputing the G1 and G3 enthalpies of formation without the HLC reveals a systematic trend where most ΔHf values are significantly higher than experimental values. By extrapolating electronic energies to the complete basis set (CBS) limit and adding G3-like corrections for the core-valence and infinite-order electron correlation effects, ccCA-CBS-2 often underestimates the experimental ΔHf, especially for larger systems. This is desired as inclusion of relativistic and atomic spin-orbit effects subsequently improves theoretical ΔHf values to give a 0.81kcalmol−1 mean absolute deviation with ccCA-CBS-2. The ccCA-CBS method is a viable “black box” method that can be used on systems with at least 10-15 heavy atoms.}}

For thermochemical properties such as the heat of formation, the zero-point vibrational energy also becomes important, introducing its own set of difficulties to the computational approach. Changes in the various components as the chemical systems incorporate heavier elements and as the size of the systems grows are also considered. Finally, challenges arising from the desire to extend existing methods to transition metal and heavier elements are considered.}

Title = {{Solid-liquid transitions of sodium chloride at high pressures}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{125}},
Abstract = {{We investigate solid-liquid transitions in NaCl at high pressures using
   molecular dynamics simulations, including the melting curve and
   superheating/supercooling as well as solid-solid and liquid-liquid
   transitions. The first-order B1-B2 (NaCl-CsCl type) transition in solid
   is observed at high pressures besides continuous liquid structure
   transitions, which are largely analogous to the B1-B2 transition in
   solid. The equilibrium melting temperatures (T-m) up to megabar pressure
   are obtained from the solid-liquid coexistence technique and the
   superheating-supercooling hysteresis method. Lindemann's vibrational and
   Born's mechanical instabilities are found upon melting. The Lindemann
   frequency is calculated from the vibrational density of states. The
   Lindemann parameter (fractional root-mean-squared displacement)
   increases with pressure and approaches a constant asymptotically,
   similar to the Lennard-Jones system. However, the Lindemann melting
   relation holds for both B1 and B2 phases to high accuracy as for the
   Lennard-Jonesium. The B1 and B2 NaCl solids can be superheated by
   0.18T(m) and 0.24T(m), and the NaCl liquid, supercooled by 0.22T(m) and
   0.32T(m), respectively, at heating or cooling rates of 1 K/s and 1 K/ps.
   The amount of maximum superheating or supercooling and its weak pressure
   dependence observed for NaCl are in accord with experiments on alkali
   halides and with simulations on the Lennard-Jones system and Al. (c)

Title = {{Physics of solid and liquid alkali halide surfaces near the melting
   point}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{123}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a broad theoretical and simulation study of the
   high-temperature behavior of crystalline alkali halide surfaces typified
   by NaCl(100), of the liquid NaCl surface near freezing, and of the very
   unusual partial wetting of the solid surface by the melt. Simulations
   are conducted using two-body rigid-ion Born-Mayer-Huggins-Fumi-Tosi
   (BMHFT) potentials, with full treatment of long-range Coulomb forces.
   After a preliminary check of the description of bulk NaCl provided by
   these potentials, which seems generally good even at the melting point,
   we carry out a new investigation of solid and liquid surfaces. Solid
   NaCl(100) is found in this model to be very anharmonic and yet
   exceptionally stable when hot. It is predicted by a thermodynamic
   integration calculation of the surface free energy that NaCl(100) should
   be a well-ordered, nonmelting surface, metastable even well above the
   melting point. By contrast, the simulated liquid NaCl surface is found
   to exhibit large thermal fluctuations and no layering order. In spite of
   that, it is shown to possess a relatively large surface free energy. The
   latter is traced to a surface entropy deficit, reflecting some kind of
   surface short-range order. We show that the surface short-range order is
   most likely caused by the continuous transition of the bulk ionic melt
   into the vapor, made of NaCl molecules and dimers rather than of single
   ions. Finally, the solid-liquid interface free energy is derived through
   Young's equation from direct simulation of partial wetting of NaCl(100)
   by a liquid droplet. The resulting interface free energy is large, in
   line with the conspicuous solid-liquid 27\% density difference. A
   partial wetting angle near 50 S close to the experimental value of 48 S
   is obtained in the process. It is concluded that three elements, namely,
   the exceptional anharmonic stability of the solid (100) surface, the
   molecular short-range order at the liquid surface, and the costly
   solid-liquid interface, all conspire to cause the anomalously poor
   wetting of the (100) surface by its own melt in the BMHFT model of NaCl-
   and most likely also in real alkali halide surfaces. (c) 2005 American

abstract  ="Static polarizabilities are the first response of the electron density to electric fields, and are therefore important for predicting intermolecular and molecule-field interactions. They also offer a global measure of the accuracy of the treatment of excited states by density functionals in a formally exact manner. We have developed a database of benchmark static polarizabilities for 132 small species at equilibrium geometry, using coupled cluster theory through triple excitations (extrapolated to the complete basis set limit), for the purpose of developing and assessing density functionals. The performance of 60 popular and recent functionals are also assessed, which indicates that double hybrid functionals perform the best, having RMS errors in the range of 2.5-3.8%% . Many hybrid functionals also give quite reasonable estimates with 4-5%% RMSE. A few meta-GGAs like mBEEF and MVS yield performance comparable to hybrids, indicating potential for improved excited state predictions relative to typical local functionals. Some recent functionals however are found to be prone to catastrophic failure (possibly as a consequence of overparameterization), indicating a need for caution in applying these."}

Although a range of wave function and density functional theory (DFT) methods have been applied in these calculations, combined with a variety of basis sets, there has not been a comprehensive evaluation of how accurate these methods are. To benchmark the accuracy of these methods, the dipole moments and polarizabilities of a set of 46 molecules were calculated using a broad set of quantum chemical methods and basis sets. Wave function methods Hartree−Fock (HF), second-order Møller−Plesset (MP2), and coupled cluster-singles and doubles (CCSD) were evaluated, along with the PBE, TPSS, TPSSh, PBE0, B3LYP, M06, and B2PLYP DFT functionals. The cc-pVDZ, cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVTZ, and Sadlej cc-pVTZ basis sets were tested. The aug-cc-pVDZ, Sadlej cc-pVTZ, and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets all yield results with comparable accuracy, with the aug-cc-pVTZ calculations being the most accurate. CCSD, MP2, or hybrid DFT methods using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set are all able to predict dipole moments with RMSD errors in the 0.12−0.13 D range and polarizabilities with RMSD errors in the 0.30−0.38 Å3 range. Calculations using Hartree−Fock theory systematically overestimated dipole moments and underestimate polarizabilities. The pure DFT functionals included in this study (PBE and TPSS) slightly underestimate dipole moments and overestimate polarizability. Polarization anisotropy and implications for charge fitting are discussed.}}

technique  using statistical analysis of the fluctuations of
fluorescence in a system  in order to decipher dynamic molecular
events, such as diffusion or  conformational fluctuations of
biomolecules. First introduced by Magde et al  to measure
the diffusion and binding of ethidium bromide onto 
double-stranded DNA, the technique has been undergoing a
renaissance since  1993 with the implementation of confocal
microscopy FCS. Since then, a  flurry of experiments has
implemented FCS to characterize the photochemistry  of dyes, the
translational and rotational mobilities of fluorescent 
molecules, as well as to monitor conformational fluctuations of
green  fluorescent proteins and DNA molecules.

In this review, we present the analytical formalism of an FCS
measurement,  as well as practical considerations for the design
of an FCS setup and  experiment. We then review the recent
applications of FCS in analytical  chemistry, biophysics and
cell biology, specifically emphasizing the  advantages and
pitfalls of the technique compared to alternative  spectroscopic
tools. We also discuss recent extensions of FCS in 
single-molecule spectroscopy, offering alternative data
processing of  fluorescence signals to glean more information on
the kinetic processes.}

Volume = {{132}},
OPTNumber = {{3}},
Pages = {{1137-1143}},
OPTMonth = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Hydride transfer catalyzed by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has been
   described previously within an environmentally coupled model of hydrogen
   tunneling, where protein motions control binding of substrate and
   cofactor to generate a tunneling ready conformation and modulate the
   width of the activation barrier and hence the reaction rate. Changes to
   the composition of the reaction medium are known to perturb protein
   motions. We have measured kinetic parameters of the reaction catalyzed
   by DHFR from Escherichia coli in the presence of various cosolvents and
   cosolutes and show that the dielectric constant, but not the viscosity,
   of the reaction medium affects the rate of reaction. Neither the primary
   kinetic isotope effect on the reaction nor its temperature dependence
   were affected by changes to the bulk solvent properties. These results
   are in agreement with our previous report on the effect of solvent
   composition on catalysis by DHFR from the hyperthermophile Thermotoga
   maritima. However, the effect of solvent on the temperature dependence
   of the kinetic isotope effect on hydride transfer catalyzed by E. Coll
   DHFR is difficult to explain within a model, in which long-range motions
   couple to the chemical step of the reaction, but may indicate the
   existence of a short-range promoting vibration or the presence of
   multiple nearly isoenergetic conformational substates of enzymes with
   similar but distinct catalytic properties.}},

Title = {{Thermal energy storage using chloride salts and their eutectics}},
Abstract = {{Achieving the goals of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Sunshot
   initiative requires (1) higher operating temperatures for concentrating
   solar power (CSP) plants to increase theoretical efficiency, and (2)
   effective thermal energy storage (TES) strategies to ensure
   dispatchability. Current inorganic salt-based TES systems in large-scale
   CSP plants generally employ molten nitrate salts for energy storage, but
   nitrate salts are limited in application to lower
   temperatures-generally, below 600 degrees C. These materials are
   sufficient for parabolic trough power plants, but they are inadequate
   for use at higher temperatures. At the higher operating temperatures
   achievable in solar power tower-type CSP plants, chloride salts are
   promising candidates for application as TES materials, owing to their
   thermal stability and generally lower cost compared to nitrate salts.
   In light of this, a recent study was conducted, which included a
   preliminary survey of chloride salts and binary eutectic systems that
   show promise as high temperature TES media. This study provided some
   basic information about the salts, including phase equilibria data and
   estimates of latent heat of fusion for some of the eutectics. Cost
   estimates were obtained through a review of bulk pricing for the pure
   salts among various vendors.
   This review paper updates that prior study, adding data for additional
   salt eutectic systems obtained from the literature. Where possible, data
   are obtained from the thermodynamic database software, FactSage.
   Radiative properties are presented, as well, since at higher
   temperatures, thermal radiation becomes a significant mode of heat
   transfer. Material compatibility for inorganic salts is another
   important consideration (e.g., with regard to piping and/or
   containment), so a summary of corrosion studies with various materials
   is also presented. Lastly, cost data for these systems are presented,
   allowing for meaningful comparison among these systems and other
   materials for TES applications. Because chloride salts may be employed
   as either sensible heat storage in the molten phase or as sensible and
   latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) as phase change materials
   (PCMs), cost of the candidate salt systems are presented on a cost per
   unit mass basis (sensible heat storage application) and a cost per unit
   latent heat of fusion basis (latent heat storage application). A total
   of 133 chloride salt systems were investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Boron Carbon Nitride Nanostructures from Salt Melts: Tunable
   Water-Soluble Phosphors}},
Abstract = {{A simple, high yield, chemical process is developed to fabricate layered
   h-BN nanosheets and BCNO nanoparticles with a diameter of ca. 5 nm at
   700 degrees C. The use of the eutectic LiCl/KCl salt melt medium
   enhances the kinetics of the reaction between sodium borohydride and
   urea or guanidine as well as the dispersion of the nanoparticles in
   water. The carbon content can be tuned from 0 to 50 mol \% by adjusting
   the reactant ratio, thus providing precise control of the light emission
   of the particles in the range 440-528 rim while reaching a quantum yield
   of 26\%. Because of their green synthesis, low toxicity, small size, and
   stability against aggregation in water, the as-obtained photoluminescent
   BCNO nanoparticles show promise for diagnostics and optoelectronics.}},
