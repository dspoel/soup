# Making Soup

The cytoplasm of a cell is sometimes jestingly called a Soup, since it contains many different ingredients. Indeed there is quite a bit of salt and glutamate, the well know flavour enhancing compoud that is used a lot in asian kitchen but also in broth.

In order to study the cytoplasm of a cell one can use a variety of experimental biochemistry techniques, but also computer simulations, which is the focus of this page. Here we thererfore provide information and python scripts to run computer simulations using http://www.gromacs.org of (quite) realistic models of the cytoplasm.

The main work is done here by a few scripts, located in the aptly named scripts directory. They are described briefly in the README.md in that directory.

A preprint of the article describing this work will be made available on chemrxiv at http://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.10102289
